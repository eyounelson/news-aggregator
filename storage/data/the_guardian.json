Who among us hasn\u2019t been roped into speculation about this family tragedy, the carcass of which has been picked over by pundits, amateurs and experts for years now?<\/p> <p>Over 11 long weeks, the baroque details of the trial of Erin Patterson were made immediately available to a ravenous public \u2013 including sightings of Helen Garner, Chloe Hooper and Sarah Krasnostein, three of Australia\u2019s most celebrated nonfiction writers, in the public seats of courtroom four in Morwell, Victoria. Were there several works of Australian literary nonfiction about Erin Patterson in the offing? A week after the guilty verdict was handed down, Text Publishing announced that the trio would collaborate on a book: The Mushroom Tapes.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2025\/nov\/08\/mushroom-murders-erin-patterson-book-helen-garner-sarah-krasnostein-chloe-hooper-interview\">\u2018Erin Patterson remains mysterious to me\u2019: Helen Garner, Sarah Krasnostein and Chloe Hooper on the mushroom murders<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>I approached this book with a fair dose of scepticism. Two major books on the trial have already been published, with more to come. Didn\u2019t the bereft families deserve some peace? And why the rush? Did this book really need to be written in time for the Christmas sales period?<\/p> <p>A similar mixture of compulsion and resistance afflicts the authors of The Mushroom Tapes: \u201cPeople say to us, you must be going. No, we answer. No. No. No.\u201d But they do go to Morwell. \u201cThe current of the story,\u201d they write, \u201chas a stronger pull than we had expected.\u201d<\/p> <p>Garner, Hooper and Krasnostein appear in the book as Helen, Chloe and Sarah. Their collaboration was conceived as a podcast and much of the book is drawn from transcripts of conversations recorded while travelling between Morwell and Melbourne. They are often on the road but never able to stay in Morwell for long. The result is a work of oral literature that has been yoked to the page; conversations between friends, conversations between women. At one point, Garner says: \u201cIf anybody wants a mandarin or a biscuit, just kindly scream out and I\u2019ll pass it over.\u201d In a different book, such asides might have been edited out. Here they signal an interest in the ephemera of daily life, in the nourishment required to sustain conversations, friendships and families.<\/p> <p>In both their rhythm and register, these intimate conversations recall the forms that mediated Patterson\u2019s trial: podcasts, panel discussions, social media threads, group chats. We talk to make sense of the world \u2013 and everybody has something to say about Erin Patterson. \u201cPeople are <em>obsessed<\/em>,\u201d Hooper writes. \u201cI run into someone at my kids\u2019 sport, or the hairdresser, or wherever \u2013 they\u2019re either listening to two podcasts a day and know more detail about the trial than I do, or they\u2019re equally as strongly repulsed.\u201d<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019m big-hearted or anything, it\u2019s just that I have this awful feeling \u2013 that could be me<\/p> <footer> <cite>Helen Garner<\/cite> <\/footer> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>And so we find ourselves in the car to Morwell with these three intelligent women as they try to figure out what is going on in the courtroom, and how the hell Erin Patterson got there. Marriage, class, sex, money, <em>mushrooms<\/em>, women and their lives \u2013 <em>our lives<\/em>.<\/p> <p>The transcripts have been carefully edited, but locutions that convey the immediacy of live commentary are retained: \u201cSarah, you\u2019re a lawyer, why has Erin decided to hold her trial in Morwell?\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s a bit too much like reading a podcast transcript. We stay in the present tense in the reported sections that break up the transcripts as well: \u201cShe sits in the dock at the back of the courtroom, flanked by two custody officers.\u201d It\u2019s as if the trial were playing on a non-stop loop. Two-podcast-a-day readers may relish the effect, but I found stasis, rather than suspense, in this unrelenting present tense.<\/p> <p>Fleeting disagreements between the authors are captured in the transcripts, and so is their equivocation:<\/p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Chloe: Are we really going to drive past Erin\u2019s house? I feel unsure about this.<\/p> <p>Sarah: For me, it\u2019s a normal part of doing research.<\/p> <p>Helen: We\u2019re not knocking on anyone\u2019s door, for God\u2019s sake.<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>There is a lot of driving past significant sites in The Mushroom Tapes, and many such self-exonerating exchanges. The first line of Janet Malcolm\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/1989\/03\/13\/the-journalist-and-the-murderer-i\">classic study<\/a> of crime journalism hangs over these conversations: \u201cEvery journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.\u201d The authors of The Mushroom Tapes certainly know this. Often it is Hooper who voices her qualms most strongly. At one point she says: \u201cThis trial is being used for public entertainment. I feel squeamish about joining the pile-on.\u201d And yet, here is the book.<\/p> <p>The authors give the victims of the murders their due, and they write with great compassion about the unnamed children of Erin and Simon Patterson; \u201cthey\u2019ve been handed this bag of stones that they\u2019ll carry for the rest of their lives,\u201d says Krasnostein, one of the book\u2019s most memorable lines.<\/p> <p>It is Erin Patterson, however, who captivates them. Patterson bounces, says Krasnostein, \u201cbetween smallness and grandiosity\u201d; Hooper notes that she \u201cradiates discontent\u201d. In an early conversation, Garner says, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m big-hearted or anything, it\u2019s just that I have this awful feeling \u2013 that could be me.\u201d It\u2019s quickly established that Patterson is not, in fact, much of a stranger at all; the authors write \u201cwe have discovered that the three of us are variously connected to Erin Patterson and the wider family\u201d. After taking in Patterson\u2019s time in the stand, Garner observes that \u201cthe gap between her and me shrank down really small\u201d.<\/p> <p>This combination of personalisation and projection is now omnipresent in the culture. It is why I found it ultimately difficult to extract The Mushroom Tapes, for all that it is extremely readable, from the rest of the chatter about the Patterson case. Garner, Hooper and Krasnostein are an acute trio of conversational partners. Their precise, wry observations compel the reader\u2019s attention \u2013 but so did all the loud headlines and live-crosses that kept this calamity in public view.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2025\/nov\/05\/im-never-surprised-when-i-read-about-a-woman-murdering-a-man-helen-garner-on-her-baillie-gifford-prize-winning-diaries\">\u2018I\u2019m never surprised when I read about a woman murdering a man\u2019: Helen Garner on her Baillie Gifford prize-winning diaries<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>In its formal commitment to immediacy and intimacy, not to mention its speedy publication schedule, The Mushroom Tapes reflects the moment in which it was written. I wonder whether a collaboration that had been allowed to develop more slowly might finally have relinquished the present tense, and put this case in the past. As for whether this is the last word on the Patterson case, certainly not. A series of conversations across Australia with the authors of The Mushroom Tapes sold out well before the publication date of the book. The talk about Erin Patterson, it seems, is not likely to stop soon.<\/p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Mushroom Tapes is out now in Australia (Text Publishing, $36.99) and will be published in the UK on 20 November<\/em><\/p><\/li> <\/ul>"

                    "body": "<p>Climate-related disasters forcibly displaced 250 million people globally over the past decade, the equivalent of 70,000 people every day, according to a report by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR).<\/p> <p>Floods, storms, drought and extreme heat are among the weather conditions driving conflict and displacement, alongside slow-onset disasters such as desertification, rising sea levels and ecosystem destruction, which are threatening food and water security.<\/p> <p>In mid-2025, 117 million people were displaced by war, violence and persecution \u2013 a dire human rights crisis that the climate emergency is rapidly intensifying.<\/p> <p>The UNHCR said the climate crisis was a \u201crisk multiplier\u201d that exposed and compounded existing inequalities and injustices, including the impact of conflict, violence and forced displacement within and across borders.<\/p> <p>The number of countries reporting both conflict and disaster-related displacement has tripled since 2009, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unhcr.org\/media\/no-escape-ii-way-forward\">No Escape II: The Way Forward<\/a>, the UNHCR\u2019s second big report on the impacts of climate refugees released Monday. Yet fragile and conflict-affected countries hosting refugees receive only a quarter of the climate finance they need.<\/p> <p>Refugees and displaced people, often living in precarious physical and political conditions, are among the hardest hit by the climate crisis despite contributing little to its causes.<\/p> <p>In May 2024, catastrophic flooding in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul killed 181 people, causing billions of dollars of damage. The floods displaced 580,000 people, including 43,000 vulnerable refugees from Venezuela, Haiti and Cuba, who were living in some of the most flood-affected areas in the region, according to UNHCR.<\/p> <p>A year earlier, Cyclone Mocha \u2013 the most destructive storm to hit Myanmar in years \u2013 made landfall in Rakhine state where 160,000 ethnic Rohingya have been living in overcrowded camps since 2012.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe had very little to begin with,\u201d Ma Phyu Ma, 37, an internally displaced Rohingya told UN researchers. \u201cThe hut was our shelter. The boat and nets allowed us to fish. The clothes were my source of income. It is painful for me to lose everything.\u201d<\/p> <p>In 2024, a third of all emergencies declared by UNHCR involved floods, drought, wildfires and other extreme weather events affecting people displaced by war.<\/p> <p>Three-quarters of refugees and other displaced people now live in countries facing high or extreme exposure to climate-related hazards, with repeated displacement becoming increasingly common.<\/p> <p>Chad, one of the most politically fragile and climate-vulnerable countries, hosts more than 1.4 million refugees and asylum seekers. In 2024 alone, floods forced more than 1.3 million people to flee their homes and camps \u2013 more than the previous 15 years combined. Refugees from war-torn Sudan receive less than 10 litres of water a day \u2013 far below emergency standards.<\/p> <p>Almost half the world\u2019s displaced people are facing conflict and climate impacts in politically fragile states, including Sudan, Syria, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Myanmar and Yemen. These countries contribute negligibly to global greenhouse gas emissions yet have limited access to climate finance and solutions needed to adapt.<\/p> <p>Without radical action to curtail climate catastrophe and help poor countries adapt, the situation is likely to get much worse, the report warns.<\/p> <p>By 2050, the hottest refugee camps could face nearly 200 days of dangerous heat stress per year, with serious risks to health and survival, with many locations becoming uninhabitable.<\/p> <p>The UNHRC is calling on climate negotiators at Cop30 in Brazil to pay attention to this largely ignored and rapidly growing population.<\/p> <p>Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said: \u201cFunding cuts are severely limiting our ability to protect refugees and displaced families from the effects of extreme weather. If we want stability, we must invest where people are most at risk. To prevent further displacement, climate financing needs to reach the communities already living on the edge.<\/p> <p>\u201cThey cannot be left alone. This Cop must deliver real action, not empty promises.\u201d<\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>We could be happy together, if only we weren\u2019t here and it wasn\u2019t now: the tragedy of sweethearts caught up in conflict, their love overcome by others\u2019 hate, is an old and powerful story. Trespasses, an adaptation of Louise Kennedy\u2019s novel, written by Ailbhe Keogan, hits that nerve.<\/p> <p>A small town outside Belfast, 1975: rancour, suspicion and grief shadow every moment in the thwarted life of Cushla (Lola Petticrew), a Catholic primary-school teacher in her mid-20s who is giving up her spare time to work shifts in her brother\u2019s pub. The priests at the school are hollering bigots, telling the children that every Protestant is an evil enemy, despite one of the kids being the son of a Catholic father and Protestant mother. Cushla takes an interest in the boy, who tends to arrive at school without a coat, and his elder brother, who shows signs of secretly sharing Cushla\u2019s love of reading. She gives them lifts back to their house on a flag-strewn Protestant estate, at the risk of her car being pelted with bricks, and redoubles her support for the family when the dad has his legs and skull broken by vengeful neighbours.<\/p> <p>In the pub, meanwhile, the British soldiers who drink there make every evening a tense ordeal, fraught with the possibility of it ending in violence that Cushla and her brother would be powerless to stop. After closing, Cushla invariably arrives home to find her widowed mother Gina (Gillian Anderson) drowning in loneliness and gin.<\/p>    <p>We know that in six months\u2019 time, Cushla will be picking through the pub\u2019s smoking ashes, with who knows who having been caught in the blast, and we suspect that this is the end of a sequence of events set in train when controversial local celebrity Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen) walks in. Cushla visibly loves him from that moment, before he has sat down and suavely ordered his first Jameson. Michael is a Protestant barrister who defends young Catholics, in the belief that securing them a fair trial is the best way for him to personally slow Northern Ireland\u2019s cycle of violence \u2013 a gesture that has made him unpopular with other Protestants, but also with Catholics, who feel he legitimises the repressive judicial system. He\u2019s a walking target, he\u2019s married and he\u2019s at least a decade older than Cushla, probably more like two. Embarking on an all-enveloping affair with him would be wild.<\/p> <p>With the tousled hair and tight waistcoat of a romantic hero from two centuries prior, Cullen\u2019s Michael is a dreamy old goat. His charisma is timeless. It\u2019s not clear how seriously Cushla (and we) should take his grand \u201cthis is the point of the series, folks\u201d speech about how \u201cwe must find the bravery to choose freedom over fear\u201d, delivered on a gorsey hillock away from all the urban warfare, but the sentiment is intoxicating anyway.<\/p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HNJF5No6NU0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/HNJF5No6NU0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ><\/iframe> <\/figure>   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s yourself,\u201d he says as she stands in front of him alone for the first time, in his posh city shag-pad. Van Morrison spins tastefully on his turntable two minutes later as Cushla dangles her head off the edge of the mattress, with Michael\u2019s head in the middle. In Cullen\u2019s hands, the guy has game, and the show wouldn\u2019t work if he didn\u2019t. But the bigger burden is borne by Petticrew, who is in every scene and who, if she played Cushla with less care, could let the character\u2019s ever-changing intentions and passionate purity tip into naivety. Instead she makes the tension between Cushla\u2019s energy and cold reality at first rousing, then heartbreaking.<\/p> <p>As it establishes itself, Trespasses seems like a collection of familiar melodramas, each borrowing from the Troubles for extra dramatic heft. We have the woman in love with a married man who isn\u2019t honest about his home life, the teacher who goes outside her remit to help a deprived pupil, and the woman whose alcoholic mother\u2019s final descent to oblivion will surely coincide with the one time her daughter focuses on her own happiness. It\u2019s all Cushla, with each relationship drawing on the visceral enmity between Catholics and Protestants to rescue it from cliche. But the narrative is constructed with deceptive skill. Small moments and minor characters turn out to be crucial and, as the strands knit together, agonising ironies pile up.<\/p> <p>Strip down the show\u2019s politics and they would be dangerously close to a hand-wringing plea for both sides to stop being as bad as each other, to end the violence, and won\u2019t somebody please think of the children. But the Troubles give Trespasses what it needs. As individuals\u2019 hopes and feelings are crushed in the gears of events much bigger than them, we feel that pain.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Trespasses is on Channel 4 now.<\/p>"

The flip between the dream of driving for this amazing team and then the nightmare of the results that we\u2019ve had. We are just really having to fight through those hardships at the moment.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/live\/2025\/nov\/09\/sao-paulo-grand-prix-formula-one-live\">Lando Norris victorious after a thrilling S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix \u2013 as it happened<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>\u201cThis weekend has been disastrous and disappointing for everyone. I am trying to keep my head above water and remain positive.\u201d<\/p> <p>In a race won by Lando Norris to extend his world championship lead to 24 points from his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, Hamilton once more toiled to little effect. He had qualified in 13th and then early in the race was clipped by Carlos Sainz and shortly afterwards took floor damage when he misjudged an attempted pass on Franco Colapinto.<\/p> <p>He was forced to retire the car on lap 37, another poor result in a season in which he is sixth in the championship, 66 points behind his teammate, Charles Leclerc, and still without a podium finish.<\/p> <p>However, the seven-time champion remained resolute that he and Ferrari would find their feet as they focus on next season. \u201cI believe there is something extraordinary up ahead in my life and in my destiny,\u201d he said. \u201cI truly still believe in this team and what we can achieve together. I just have to keep pushing and keep giving them everything I can.\u201d<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, a punchy Norris has insisted he would ignore critics \u201ctalking crap\u201d and attempting to bring him down as he focused only on himself in attempting to close out his first world championship, after victory in Brazil.<\/p> <p>Norris won at Interlagos with a superb drive from pole position but immediately after the race hit out at questions that had been raised previously regarding his ability to fight for a title. \u201cJust ignore everyone that talks crap about you and focus on yourself,\u201d he said of his approach since he came from behind to retake the lead in the title race.<\/p> <p>He was the subject of booing at the last round in Mexico and went on to emphasise that he felt he had to cut out the noise that now surrounds the title fight with three races remaining.<\/p> <p>\u201cThere are always people out there who try to bring you down a bit. You are on the big stage and there people talk, say things, trying to influence others to have effects. Even the cheers and the not-cheers. You hear it. It\u2019s not the nicest thing. But it is something I have evolved over the last few months to deal with.<\/p> <p>\u201cI care a lot about people\u2019s perspectives, and how I am portrayed and things in the media, and I probably cared too much at the beginning of the year. It was affecting me in not the best ways. I have learned to deal with those things better.\u201d<\/p>"

I am reliably informed that is the biggest blown lead in Jacksonville\u2019s history. Kicking a big cat when it\u2019s down aside that is a huge win for the Texans. They keep their hopes of the playoffs alive tonight at 4-5. A division title feels very unlikely with the Colts on 8-2 but a wild card still is very possible with CJ Stroud coming back soon hopefully at quarterback.<\/p> <p>And those 8-2 Colts is where the performance of the day comes from in Berlin. Jonathan Taylor was unbelievable. The running back is keeping his name in the MVP conversation after 244 yards on 32 carries and three more touchdowns. Taylor now has 15 rushing scores in 10 games, his best in a single season is 18 so he should comfortably smash that mark. Today\u2019s effort also has him smash through the thousand yard barrier to 1,139 total on the ground so far. Vegas have him has joint-second favourite for the individual honour.<\/p> <p>With those heady numbers swirling, I will say guten abend.

Alles klar I hope on this fine early start to week 10 coming straight outta Deutschland. The Olympiastadion in Berlin to be exact where at 8.30am CST\/9.30am EST and 2.30pm GMT the mighty Indianapolis Colts (7-2) take on the Atlanta Falcons (3-5). The fifth game played on German soil and the first in the nation\u2019s capital.<\/p> <p>The news hounds among you may have picked up on the Colts being involved in some rather <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2025\/nov\/04\/nfl-trade-deadline-colts-sauce-gardner-jets\">large business on trade deadline day<\/a>. So what looked like an intriguing one between a playoff contender and a team fighting to turn things around has been turned up several notches by Indianapolis trading for star cornerback Sauce Gardner. Yes, on Tuesday they engaged in some rather punchy retail therapy to shake off the sadness of losing to Pittsburgh. The Colts dispensed two future first-round draft picks and receiver Adonai Mitchell in exchange for the highest paid corner in the NFL. Indianapolis are all in on the Super Bowl and handily Gardner has cleared concussion protocol for a first appearance since week seven today to aid that endeavour.<\/p> <p>His first assignment will most likely be tracking Drake London. As head-to-heads go this could be a classic. Atlanta\u2019s premier pass catcher starts in good form after nabbing three touchdowns last week with more than 100 yards in three of his past four games. So no pressure, Sauce. But the $120m man will likely back himself. A good on good matchup as they say.<\/p> <p>Da steppt der B\u00e4r!<\/p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/shorts\/GZ8PG7hDKT8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/GZ8PG7hDKT8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ><\/iframe>  <\/figure>  <\/div>   <\/div>"

The USDA did not immediately respond to a request for clarification from the AP.<\/p> <p>Lisa Murkowski, a Republican senator for Alaska, said it would be \u201cshocking\u201d if the order applied to states using their own money to support the program.<\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing if the federal government is going to continue its level of appeal through the courts to say, \u2018No, this can\u2019t be done,\u2019\u201d Murkowski told the AP. \u201cBut when you are telling the states that have said this is a significant enough issue in our state, we\u2019re going to find resources, backfill or front load, whatever term you want, to help our people, those states should not be penalized.\u201d<\/p> <p>On Sunday several state leaders criticized the memo.<\/p> <p>Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, refused to abide by the directive.<\/p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Evers <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/mattsmith_news\/status\/1987563451204460773\/photo\/1\">said<\/a> in a statement responding to the memo. \u201cPursuant to and consistent with an active court order, Wisconsin legally loaded benefits to cards, ensuring nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites, including nearly 270,000 kids, had access to basic food and groceries.\u201d<\/p> <p>He added that the Trump administration had \u201cassured Wisconsin and other states that they were actively working to implement full SNAP benefits for November and would \u2018complete the processes necessary to make funds available\u201d, adding that \u201cthey have failed to do so to date.\u201d<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/nov\/03\/trump-snap-benefits-reactions\">Americans \u2018dumbfounded by cruelty\u2019 of Trump officials slashing Snap benefits<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>\u201cOur administration is actively in court fighting against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to yank food assistance away from Wisconsin\u2019s kids, families and seniors and we are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,\u201d Evers said.<\/p> <p>Oregon\u2019s Democratic governor, Tina Kotek, said in a statement that \u201cTrump\u2019s demands have no impact on\u201d the money she distributed on Thursday in line with the court order.<\/p> <p>\u201cOregon acted lawfully, given the federal court\u2019s directive and the communications with the USDA, and my decision to ensure SNAP benefits went out quickly was in direct alignment with my food emergency declaration,\u201d Kotek said. \u201cI am disgusted that President Trump has the audacity to take taxpayers\u2019 money away from them when they are in crisis. I have a question for the President: What would he prefer to spend the money on over groceries for people in need? This is ridiculous, immoral, and Oregon will fight this every step of the way.\u201d<\/p> <p>Maura Healey, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, also condemned the directive in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mass.gov\/news\/governor-healey-responds-to-president-trumps-threat-to-punish-states-for-feeding-americans\">statement<\/a> on Sunday, saying: \u201cIf President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cMassachusetts residents with funds on their cards should continue to spend it on food\u201d she said. \u201cThese funds were processed in accordance with guidance we received from the Trump Administration and a lower court order, and they were processed before the Supreme Court order on Friday night.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cPresident Trump should be focusing on reopening the government that he controls instead of repeatedly fighting to take away food from American families,\u201d she added.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar<\/a>, a Democratic senator for Minnesota, also <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/SenAmyKlobuchar\/status\/1987546099301679194?s=20\">criticized <\/a>the memo, saying that \u201ccruelty is the point\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is their choice to do this.\u201d<\/p> <p><em>Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting<\/em><\/p>"

His performance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2025\/nov\/09\/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">against Liverpool<\/a> was more like watching the young Yoda scything his way around one of those mass lightsaber massacres, whirling and gliding, aware of space, wind, the crumpling of a blade of grass behind him.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2025\/nov\/09\/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City make title statement as Haaland and Doku sweep Liverpool aside<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>Doku has one particular move, The Wand. Essentially he waves his foot over the ball and runs off the other way. Sounds easy. You try doing it. Here he spent his entire 74 minutes on the pitch making elite footballers vanish.<\/p> <p>He did it to Mo Salah an hour into a gruelling game on a sodden pitch. A bit later he was double-teamed by Ryan Gravenberch and Conor Bradley, slowed to a walk, stopped, then out came the wand. Expelliarmus! They both vanished, Doku easing through the space to batter a shot at goal.<\/p> <p>He was always going to score. When he did it was in part a product of the mental pain inflicted on the Liverpool defence in the preceding 62 minutes. Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 was wary of getting too close. From there Doku didn\u2019t need to use his full range, just jinked to his right and walloped a thrilling shot into the far corner, a hard, flat, howling thing, basically unsaveable.<\/p> <p>Doku came off with the game done at 3-0, having completed seven dribbles, at a point where nobody else on the pitch had got past one. He has always had extraordinary gifts, amazing numbers on the physical tests, the standing jump, the sideways snap. In full flow here it looked like trying to play against a mobile forcefield, such is his control, the speed of his feet, the power of his thighs and shoulders.<\/p> <p>This is Doku\u2019s third season in Manchester. He\u2019s still only 23. Pep Guardiola was careful afterwards not to overpraise him, suggesting he probably won\u2019t ever be a truly prolific goalscorer. But it was a performance that might just make him into something else.<\/p> <p>It was too much for Liverpool in any case. This may or may not be the beginning of City\u2019s title charge. But it is surely the end of Liverpool\u2019s defence. The champions have lost five league games with 27 still to play. Title winners generally lose between three and six. Something dramatic would have to happen to this team. But it doesn\u2019t look like it will.<\/p>    <p>True, Liverpool had a goal disallowed for a very silly notion of offside. They had some good spells. Florian Wirtz played well. But if Arne Slot is struggling to find effective patterns, the poverty of his team only served to demonstrate how peerlessly good Guardiola is at this; just as Doku\u2019s development is a perfect example of what Guardiola loves, that wild hunger for building teams and working at players.<\/p> <p>Manchester had been agreeable, damp and mild at kick-off, with moody skies and squalls of drizzle, the most Sunday of all November Sundays. What stood out early on was City\u2019s fluidity. Doku roamed, as did Rayan Cherki and Bernardo Silva. Konat\u00e9 had one of those days where he seems to be playing in roller skates. But he suffered also from the brittleness of Liverpool\u2019s midfield.<\/p> <p>Before kick-off City had screened a gushing coronational video in honour of Pep\u2019s 1,000th game as a manager. The opening goal was this team\u2019s own tribute, like a flick back through ages. It began deep on the left, Doku and Silva zipping the ball forward, one of those moments where a team just seems to be speaking to itself.<\/p> <p>From there it became like a version of Carlos Alberto\u2019s back-to-front goal for Brazil against Italy in 1970, but with a modern mash-up of controlled possession chucked into the mix as City showcased some classic Pep style, like one of those moments at an Olympics opening ceremony where suddenly everyone\u2019s morris dancing or Tim Berners-Lee is inventing the internet.<\/p> <p>From there it was current Pep. Matheus Nunes swung in a cross for Erling Haaland to score with a header that was either a bit fortunate in its slight deflection off Konat\u00e9, or a case of the more I lurk in space waiting to head the ball in, the luckier I get.<\/p> <p>Either side of the goal City were far the better team, and in an interesting way. Guardiola\u2019s triple No 10 system looks full of promise. Seven of the starting outfield 10 were 23 or under. Nico Gonz\u00e1lez had another fine game. Phil Foden looks bright and perky. Even his hair looks different, looser and more expressive, the hair of a well-groomed pirate.<\/p> <p>And City have now won five out of their past six in the league. They must be serious title challengers, maybe even favourites given they have done this many times before, that there are no bars to be raised or ghosts to be slain. Guardiola can surely feel it, even if he won\u2019t say. And Arsenal will too from here.<\/p>"

It has been a special night with my kids here.\u201d<\/p> <p>Of Doku, Guardiola said: \u201cI think he will never be a top scorer, to be honest, but he\u2019s demanding himself to be better, he listens, and has special attributes of dribbling. He was aggressive with and without the ball. We tried to help him and he played an outstanding game.\u201d<\/p> <p>Guardiola, for whom this was a 550th game as City\u2019s manager, was asked about Arsenal dropping two points at Sunderland on Saturday. \u201cI think Liverpool and us said: \u2018Oh wow, Arsenal dropped points finally and conceded two goals.\u2019 But I said to the players not to do it because yesterday Arsenal didn\u2019t win. Do it because we believe in ourselves that we can play against the champions of England and show them we are ready to be there with them this season. Today we proved it \u2013 especially in the first half.\u201d<\/p>    <p>Liverpool\u2019s defeat was the champions\u2019 fifth in their past six league games. Arne Slot was asked to assess the number in the context of their title defence. \u201cIt feels as if there are too many,\u201d the manager said.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe last thing we should think about is the title race and we should focus on getting result after result after result as we are seventh or eighth. The best time to judge the league table is after 38 but the next best is after 19 when everyone has played the same opponent.\u201d<\/p> <p>Slot was asked about Van Dijk\u2019s disallowed header, ruled out after Andy Robertson was adjudged to be offside and interfering with play. \u201cIt is obvious and clear that the wrong decision has been made. He [Robertson] didn\u2019t interfere at all with what the goalkeeper could do,\u201d the manager said.<\/p> <p>The Dutchman said that the referee, Chris Kavanagh, awarded John Stones\u2019s goal for City in the 2-1 win against Wolves last season when Bernardo Silva was in a similar zone in front of the Wolves goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1.<\/p> <p>He said: \u201cImmediately after the game someone showed me the goal that the same referee allowed \u2013 City against Wolves last season. So it took the linesman 13 seconds to raise his flag [today] to say it was offside. So there was clearly communication \u2013 but as I said, that could have influenced the game in a positive way for us.\u201d<\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>The start of a new Welsh rugby chapter left fans reading the same old story, Argentina claiming their biggest ever win over the hosts and consigning Wales to their 19th defeat in 20 Tests.<\/p> \n<p>Welsh supporters had hoped the team had turned a page in the summer after they ended their losing streak with a win over Japan and had since given the reins to their new head coach, Steve Tandy. But it\u2019s clear there is still a lot of work to do to get this once formidable Wales team back to its glory days.<\/p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2025\/nov\/09\/arundell-has-god-given-talents-it-would-be-a-dereliction-of-duty-not-to-harness-them\">It would be dereliction of Borthwick\u2019s duty not to harness Arundell\u2019s raw talent | Gerard Meagher<\/a> <\/p> \n<\/aside> \n<p>Alongside their torrid form, discussions will be focused on the Wales centre Ben Thomas after he escaped a red card. Thomas was being held in a ruck and kicked a leg towards Pablo Matera\u2019s head, for which he was shown a yellow card. The incident was referred to bunker review but remained at the sin bin threshold, the fact he did not make contact with Matera\u2019s head a large part of the reason why. However, the decision was heavily discussed with the former referee Nigel Owens putting the case forward on S4C that Thomas should not have even had a yellow card, while many fans believed the punishment should have seen him shown a straight red.<\/p> \n<p>Tandy said of the incident: \u201cThere is not a real angle that I have seen that is conclusive to what it is. I think there is lots going on. If it is lashing out, you can\u2019t do that. But also when I am looking at it in a broader sense, there is a lot of holding on the floor so if you are trying to free yourself [that can happen]. We will probably get a proper angle so I can assess it better.\u201d<\/p> \n<p>The result was not the only bad news for Wales as their stalwart captain, Jac Morgan, who was the team\u2019s brightest spark, dislocated his shoulder in the process of scoring a try. Tandy confirmed the back-row was \u201cnot looking good for the rest of the autumn\u201d and that they would be calling someone else up.<\/p> \n<p>There were some positive aspects to Wales\u2019 game, predominantly through Morgan and the full-back Blair Murray, but another encouraging detail for Wales was the return of Louis Rees-Zammit. The wing left rugby in early 2024 to pursue his NFL dream but came back to rugby in August, signing for Bristol Bears. He has been struggling with injury which meant his return at the Principality Stadium was one as a replacement off of the bench. The 24-year-old, whose last Test appearance came against Argentina in the 2023 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, came on in the 45th minute and he brought some much-needed voracity in attack.<\/p> \n<p>For Argentina, the winger Mateo Carreras was a star all afternoon and was at the heart of everything good the visitors produced.<\/p> \n<p>Chatter on trains pre-game underlined the pressure this team is under. Two groups of fans met on a packed carriage and started talking about recent results. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing isn\u2019t it,\u201d one said, while the other replied: \u201cI know, you don\u2019t like to say you\u2019re Welsh sometimes.\u201d Thousands of empty seats at the Principality Stadium was further evidence of how many Welsh fans currently feel about their team.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"95367391-a611-4375-93db-979dda026e7b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><b>Wales&nbsp;<\/b>Murray; Rogers (Rees-Zammit 44), Llewellyn, B Thomas, Adams; Edwards (J Evans 65), T Williams (Hardy 76); Carre (Smith 44), Lake (Belcher 55), Assiratti (Griffin 44), D Jenkins, Beard, Mann, Morgan (Cracknell 55), Wainwright (F Thomas 65). <\/p>\n    <p><b>Tries&nbsp;<\/b>Williams, Lake, Morgan, Murray. <b>Cons&nbsp;<\/b>Edwards (3), J Evans<br><\/p>\n    <p><b>Argentina&nbsp;<\/b>S Carreras; Delguy, Piccardo, Chocobares (Mallia 59), M Carreras (Isgro 61); Prisciantelli, Ben\u00edtez Cruz (Moyano 65); Vivas (Gallo 45), Montoya (Ru\u00edz 67)), Delgado (Rapetti 45), Petti, Kremer (Alemanno 61), Matera, JM Gonz\u00e1lez, Oviedo (Grondona 59). <\/p>\n    <p><b>Tries<\/b>&nbsp;Delgado, M Carreras, Cruz, Delguy, Prisciantelli (2), Grondona. <b>Cons<\/b> S Carreras (7).&nbsp;<b>Pen<\/b>: S Carreras<br><br><b>Referee<\/b> Ben O'Keeffe (NZ)<br><b>Attendance&nbsp;<\/b>50,185<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n   <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n <\/gu-atom> \n<\/figure> \n<p>The roof was firmly shut, blocking out the wet weather and amplifying voices, and the anthems ignited a tantalising atmosphere. Argentina were out of the blocks quickly with two sensational tries but Wales levelled the scores through Tomos Williams and the hooker Dewi Lake, which had supporters in a full chorus of \u201cWales, Wales, Wales.\u201d However, those chants were soon muted when Argentina regained their lead after Thomas\u2019 yellow card.<\/p> \n<p>The hosts needed to be the next to score but a stop-start run finished off a try for the wing Bautista Delguy, which strengthened Argentina\u2019s grip on the game. A sin bin for Williams for an off-the-ball tackle saw Wales reduced again but Morgan scored next. However, it was the visitors who polished off the game with two more tries.<\/p> \n<p>There are some caveats to this result. It was Tandy\u2019s first game in charge and it will take time to change Wales\u2019 fortunes. It was also the hosts\u2019 first game since July, while Argentina have some miles in their legs after competing in the Rugby Championship. Only time will tell how long such caveats excuse results and Tandy faces his next test on Saturday when his team faces Japan.<\/p>"

                    "body": "<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump<\/a> on Sunday mused about giving most Americans $2,000 funded by tariff revenues collected by the president\u2019s administration \u2013 an evident bid to rally public support on the issue.<\/p> <p>\u201cA dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\u201d Trump wrote on his <a href=\"https:\/\/truthsocial.com\/@realDonaldTrump\/posts\/115519726463094783\">Truth Social<\/a> platform on Sunday.<\/p> <p>The post also made it a point to call people against tariffs \u201cFOOLS!\u201d<\/p> <p>For such a plan to take effect, congressional approval would likely be required. Earlier this year, Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill proposing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hawley.senate.gov\/hawley-introduces-legislation-to-send-rebate-checks-to-working-americans\/\">$600 in tariff rebates<\/a> for nearly all Americans and their dependent children.<\/p> <p>\u201cAmericans deserve a tax rebate after four years of [Joe] Biden [White House] policies that have devastated families\u2019 savings and livelihoods,\u201d Hawley said at the time. He said the legislation would \u201callow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump\u2019s tariffs are returning to this country\u201d.<\/p> <p>However, US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in August that the administration\u2019s main focus remains reducing the national debt, which stands at $38.12tn, using funds from tariff collections. He said the money would be used first to start paying down the federal debt \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/bessent-says-us-tariff-revenues-rise-substantially-focus-reducing-debt-2025-08-19\/\">not to give<\/a> rebate checks to Americans.<\/p> <p>According to the treasury department\u2019s September report, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiscal.treasury.gov\/files\/reports-statements\/mts\/mts0925.pdf\">$195bn<\/a> in customs duties were collected during the first three quarters of the year.<\/p> <p>Though, it appears that the cost of giving out $2,000 checks could easily surpass the amount actually collected from the tariffs. According to calculations, these payments would cost close to if not more than double the amount that has reportedly been generated so far.<\/p> <p>\u201cIf the cutoff is $100,000, 150M adults would qualify, for a cost near $300 billion,\u201d wrote Erica York, vice-president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, on <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/ericadyork\/status\/1987519882351841674\">social media<\/a>. \u201cIf kids qualify, that grows.\u201d<\/p> <p>\u201cThe math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs\u201d, York added. \u201cAdjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump\u2019s proposed $300 billion rebate.\u201d<\/p> <p>John Arnold, co-chair of Arnold Ventures, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/JohnArnoldFndtn\/status\/1987533784376299622\">estimated<\/a> that the dividend payments could cost as much as $513bn.<\/p> <p>As of October, consumers were paying an average effective tariff rate of nearly 18%, the highest since 1934, according to data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/budgetlab.yale.edu\/research\/state-us-tariffs-october-30-2025\">Yale Budget Lab<\/a>. Since the president introduced widespread tariffs on global trading partners in April, companies have passed part of those costs on to consumers.<\/p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has floated the idea of giving Americans stimulus checks based on revenue from his tariffs. In October, he said that he was considering offering Americans checks from the revenue, worth somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000. In July, the president again suggested that the government might consider tariff rebate checks.<\/p> <p>In February, he and tech mogul Elon Musk, who at the time was still advising the White House, said they were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/feb\/20\/trump-doge-checks\">considering<\/a> the idea of a $5,000 \u201cdividend\u201d check based on savings generated by the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge). These payments never came to be as the national deficit actually increased under Doge, and the amount cut from federal spending was significantly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2025\/08\/12\/trump-doge-contract-claims-savings-inflation-00498178\">exaggerated<\/a>.<\/p> <p>The US supreme court <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/nov\/04\/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-oral-arguments\">heard arguments<\/a> on Wednesday on Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs and appeared skeptical of their legality.<\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>The resignation of the BBC\u2019s director general, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2025\/nov\/09\/tim-davie-expected-to-resign-bbc-director-general\">Tim Davie<\/a>, over accusations of bias comes as a shock and leaves a gulf at the top of the corporation when it needs leadership most. Davie stressed that the decision was his alone \u2013 neither the board, nor even many of those who led the coordinated attack among rightwing press and politicians expected it.<\/p> <p>Now the resignations of both Davie and the CEO of BBC News, Deborah Turness, have shown that baying for blood gets results.<\/p> <p>The biggest shock is that this saga began just a week ago with the leak of a 19-page \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2025\/11\/06\/read-devastating-internal-bbc-memo-in-full\/\">devastating memo<\/a>\u201d from Michael Prescott, a former political journalist who spent three years as an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/aboutthebbc\/whoweare\/michael-prescott\">external adviser<\/a> to the broadcaster, published in the Telegraph. The dossier alleges BBC Panorama doctored a speech by Trump, making him appear to support the January 6 rioters, that its Arabic coverage privileged pro-Hamas views, and that a group of LGBTQ employees had excessive influence on coverage of sex and gender. The Telegraph wrote that the BBC\u2019s very silence \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2025\/11\/07\/bbc-bias-story-silence-proves-serious-problem\/\">proves there is a serious problem<\/a>\u201d. Meanwhile, the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cblast\u201d at Nick Robinson, the only BBC staffer to publicly fight back against the accusations, leads the Mail on Sunday, and Donald Trump\u2019s press secretary has called the BBC \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2025\/nov\/08\/bbc-100-fake-news-says-donald-trumps-press-secretary\">100% fake news<\/a>\u201d<\/p> <p>Leave to one side for now the direct allegations about specific failures of BBC coverage, and the BBC\u2019s own baffling inability or unwillingness to defend itself over the past week. But the row obscures the context that explains what is, at the heart of the matter, a political campaign against the BBC that could act as a textbook example of how to confuse and undermine the kind of journalism that is, at the very least, aiming for impartiality in a sea of spin and distortion.<\/p> <p>Prescott stresses he has never been a member of a political party and that his views \u201cdo not come with any political agenda\u201d in the introduction to his 8,000-word note. Yet each criticism of BBC coverage comes from the anti-progressive culture-war playbook.<\/p> <p>For example, he is \u201cshocked\u201d that after an hour-long Panorama documentary dealing with Trump and the January 6 insurgency, there was no \u201csimilar, balancing\u201d programme about the Democrat presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. As someone who has spent years dealing with the issue of impartiality told me, this is an entirely wrongheaded and now discredited view of impartiality, the sort of view that led to airtime being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2018\/sep\/07\/bbc-we-get-climate-change-coverage-wrong-too-often\">given to climate denial<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Prescott also accuses the BBC of amplifying \u201cissues of racism\u201d. Yet his own argument and suggested source material undermines his own claims of neutrality. He cites a 2022 report by <a href=\"https:\/\/historyreclaimed.co.uk\/about-history-reclaimed\/\">History Reclaimed<\/a>, also published in the Telegraph, which highlights four BBC programmes with \u201can overly simplistic and distorted narrative about British colonial racism, slave-trading and its legacy\u201d. While some of its members are senior Oxbridge academics, History Reclaimed\u2019s website makes clear that the group was formed to counter \u201cculture war\u201d narratives in the media that suggest British history is shameful.<\/p> <p>Prescott remains \u201cmystified\u201d that his requests for BBC producers and editors to meet the report\u2019s authors were ignored. Yet in its own review at the time, the BBC concluded that History Reclaimed \u201ccherrypicking a handful of examples or highlighting genuine mistakes in thousands of hours of output on TV and radio does not constitute analysis and is not a true representation of BBC content\u201d.<\/p> <p>Sadly, there has been no corresponding BBC response to the rehashed criticism in Prescott\u2019s own extensive review of past complaints.<\/p> <p>None of this is to say that the BBC has not made mistakes. At the very least, the Panorama documentary appears to have included a bad and misleading edit of an hour-long Trump speech, which is unacceptable even if that speech was subsequently found to have encouraged insurrection. The BBC is expected to apologise on Monday over the Trump edit. That should have been enough.<\/p> <p>Prescott\u2019s 10 years as chief political correspondent and then political editor of the Sunday Times must have also helped his laser focus on two issues in particular that have divided even the BBC\u2019s biggest supporters. Its reporting in Gaza, specifically that of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2025\/jun\/29\/bbc-reckons-with-bias-accusations-over-israel-and-palestine-coverage\">BBC Arabic service<\/a> \u2013 given greater prominence recently not just because of the war but because of cuts in BBC News \u2013 has wounded many in the Jewish community, while the BBC\u2019s handling of trans rights has divided even its own staff.<\/p> <p>Yet pity the BBC that, while tiptoeing not always gracefully through these editorial minefields with thousands of hours of content, it has also to deal with enemies from within.<\/p> <p>Concerns about an apparent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/36d958ff-f6fc-45f2-bcd9-c2f088f74bf7\">conflict of interest<\/a> were raised when Johnson appointed Prescott to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politics\/2025\/nov\/07\/boris-johnson-trying-to-undermine-bbc-leadership-insiders-fear-after-leak\">advise Ofcom<\/a> over its new chair four years ago. Prescott, whose PR firm Hanover was involved in advising media companies such as Sky, has also been described as a friend of Robbie Gibb, a former Conservative government head of communications who joined the BBC board after helping to launch the rightwing news channel GB News. However, Prescott was allowed to continue in that role, and a government spokesperson said on Prescott\u2019s behalf <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2021\/nov\/01\/lobbyist-at-firm-with-close-ties-to-tories-will-help-select-ofcom-chair\">that the appointment<\/a> was \u201cfair and open and there are no conflicts of interest\u201d. He was later appointed external adviser to the BBC standards board.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2025\/nov\/09\/why-is-the-bbc-expected-to-apologise-over-a-donald-trump-speech-edit\">Why is the BBC expected to apologise over a Donald Trump speech edit?<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>Gibb himself is understood to have written a long and critical note about BBC coverage to the board in early September, a few weeks before Prescott. BBC sources tell me that the chair, Samir Shah, immediately ordered Peter Johnston, the director of editorial complaints and reviews, to work on a response and a briefing was discussed at the board on 16 October.<\/p> <p>So why has the BBC so far said nothing, apart from letting it be known that Shah is likely to apologise for the Trump edit when called to respond to the culture, media and sport committee tomorrow?<\/p> <p>Given the sheer volume of the content it airs and criticism it receives, the BBC can sometimes be forgiven for not wanting to stir passions further. But by spending days insisting that it did not comment on \u201cleaked documents\u201d, the corporation has simply looked weak and cowardly, just when it needs to be robust and brave. October Films, the independent production company that made the Trump Panorama, is said to be working on a film about Nigel Farage.<\/p> <p>With many of the criticisms already looked at and addressed internally, should it really take so long to come out with a response? These are difficult times for the BBC. About to enter into negotiations to renew its charter after more than a decade of licence-fee cuts, it is also caught in political and economic headwinds. Johnson\u2019s threat to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/politics\/2025\/11\/07\/boris-johnson-ill-stop-paying-bbc-licence-fee\/\">cancel his licence fee<\/a> comes after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2025\/jul\/15\/bbc-look-overhauling-licence-fee-300000-more-households-stop-paying\">300,000 more households<\/a> did so over the past year.<\/p> <p>Trump\u2019s threat of a lawsuit against the BBC follows his successful cowing of the US media, with a succession of commercial broadcasters agreeing to pay damages on the flimsiest of charges. The BBC must be independent of government and political interference. But to do that, it needs the trust of everyone who pays for its services. <\/p> <p>In his resignation letter, Davie pleads for a better future after 20 years at an organisation he loves. \u201cWe should champion [the BBC],\u201d he writes. \u201cNot weaponise it.\u201d It feels as if this plea is already too late.<\/p> <ul> <li><p>Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George\u2019s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

Sources within that department described a mood of dismay at Turness\u2019s exit. \u201cIt feels like a coup,\u201d one said. \u201cThis is the result of a campaign by political enemies of the BBC.\u201d<\/p> <p>It is a huge moment for the corporation, as it heads into critical talks with the government over its future and funding. The hunt is now on to fill two of the biggest roles in British media.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2025\/nov\/09\/bbc-attack-trump-telegraph-tories-tim-davie-resignation\">The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack. With these resignations, it\u2019s given in | Jane Martinson<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>The Commons culture, media and sport select committee had set a Monday deadline for the BBC to respond to the claims made by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to its editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left that role in the summer.<\/p> <p>Prescott criticised the editing of Trump\u2019s speech in an edition of Panorama, which spliced together clips from an address the US president made on 6 January 2021. The edit suggested Trump told the crowd: \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk down to the Capitol and I\u2019ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.\u201d<\/p> <p>The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart. The incident has led to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2025\/nov\/08\/bbc-100-fake-news-says-donald-trumps-press-secretary\">criticism of the BBC by Karoline Leavitt, Trump\u2019s press secretary<\/a>, who described the corporation this weekend as \u201c100% fake news\u201d and a \u201cpropaganda machine\u201d.<\/p> <p>Last night, Leavitt appeared to celebrate the departures, referring on X to her complaints about the BBC\u2019s treatment of the US president\u2019s speech.<\/p> <p>Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that \u201cvery dishonest people\u201d had \u201ctried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election\u201d, adding: \u201cOn top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for democracy!\u201d<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2025\/nov\/09\/tim-davie-the-marketing-man-who-became-the-bbcs-director-general\">Tim Davie: the marketing man who became the BBC\u2019s director general<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>In a note to staff, Davie said he had retained the \u201cunswerving and unanimous support\u201d of the BBC\u2019s board and its chair, Samir Shah, throughout. However, he said the current accusations had contributed to his decision.<\/p> <p>\u201cLike all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhile not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.\u201d<\/p> <p>Davie\u2019s departure comes after a torrid year in which the BBC has been criticised over the comments of its former presenter Gary Lineker, the livestreaming of a Glastonbury festival performance of the rap punk duo Bob Vylan, and criticisms over a Gaza documentary.<\/p> <p>The departures of Davie and Turness appear to be an attempt to protect the BBC from further attacks following Prescott\u2019s criticisms, which he made in a letter to the BBC\u2019s board.<\/p>    <p>Shah said Davie\u2019s departure was a \u201csad day\u201d for the BBC. \u201cHe has had the full support of me and the board throughout,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I understand the continued pressure on him, personally and professionally, which has led him to take this decision today. The whole board respects the decision and the reasons for it.\u201d<\/p> <p>The Prescott letter, which was passed to the Daily Telegraph, also condemned BBC Arabic for using contributors who had expressed antisemitic views. It included the views of a contributor who had previously stated online that Jews should be burned \u201cas Hitler did\u201d.

The BBC said in May that the person had been barred from being a contributor in future.<\/p> <p>The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, had said she was confident that Shah and Davie were \u201ctreating this with the seriousness that this demands\u201d.<\/p> <p>In her departure note to staff, Turness said: \u201cThe ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2013 an institution that I love.<\/p> <p>\u201cAs the CEO of BBC News and current affairs, the buck stops with me. In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down.\u201d<\/p> <p>However, she used her departure statement to push back on Prescott\u2019s allegations of general bias at the corporation. \u201cWhile mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said the corporation needs \u201cto turn a new leaf\u201d, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, called for \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d reform and Reform UK\u2019s leader, Nigel Farage, said it was the BBC\u2019s \u201clast chance\u201d.<\/p> <p>While many BBC figures believe Prescott\u2019s letter refers to some genuine errors, there is also concern it is being used by its political opponents.<\/p> <p>Some BBC figures point to an effort to shift the corporation politically, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politics\/2025\/nov\/07\/boris-johnson-trying-to-undermine-bbc-leadership-insiders-fear-after-leak\">dating back to Boris Johnson\u2019s time in government<\/a>. The Guardian has been told Prescott\u2019s appointment as an external adviser had been pushed by the BBC board member Robbie Gibb, Theresa May\u2019s former communications chief who helped set up the rightwing broadcaster GB News.<\/p> <p>Gibb was first placed on the BBC board during Johnson\u2019s time in government.

                    "body": "<p>Tim Davie has been one of the BBC\u2019s longest-serving executives. After leaving his role as vice-president of marketing and franchise at PepsiCo, Davie became director of the BBC\u2019s marketing, communications and audiences division in 2005.<\/p> <p>In 2008, he took on the role of director of the audio and music division. This involved running a variety of radio stations, including Radio 1, 2, 3, and 4.<\/p> <p>It was during this time that Davie led the plans to scrap 6 Music and the Asian Network, saying the corporation had too many stations and needed to invest in \u201cunique, high-quality radio\u201d. The BBC backed down on closing both stations after a huge public campaign.<\/p> <p>Also in 2008, Davie had to address controversy surrounding a prank call made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross to the actor Andrew Sachs on Radio 2.<\/p> <p>In 2012, Davie took on the role of chief executive of the corporation\u2019s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. In November of that year he became acting director general of the BBC after the resignation of George Entwistle, amid the Jimmy Savile crisis.<\/p> <p>Davie\u2019s stint, which lasted a matter of months until the arrival of Tony Hall, was brief but eventful. He dealt with the fallout from a Newsnight report that wrongly accused the Tory peer Lord McAlpine of child sexual abuse.<\/p> <p>Davie\u2019s return came just after the corporation ended its disastrous and highly criticised ownership of the travel publisher Lonely Planet, selling it for an \u00a380m loss, in March 2013.<\/p> <p>In 2018, Davie oversaw the merger of BBC Worldwide with the corporation\u2019s production arm. This led to the formation of BBC Studios, the corporation\u2019s main commercial subsidiary.<\/p> <p>He was the BBC\u2019s highest-paid executive, making \u00a3642,000 in 2019 \u2013 considerably more than Hall\u2019s \u00a3475,000.<\/p> <p>Davie turned down an offer to become head of the Premier League in 2019, before being named the BBC\u2019s new director general in June 2020 and taking on the role in September of that year.<\/p> <p>Davie said he was \u201chonoured\u201d to be appointed, adding that he had a \u201cdeep commitment to content of the highest quality and impartiality\u201d.<\/p> <p>Sir David Clementi, the then-chair of the BBC board, hailed Davie as \u201cone of the most respected names in the industry\u201d, adding: \u201cHis leadership and experience, both outside the BBC and within, will ensure that we are well placed to meet the opportunities and challenges of the coming years.\u201d<\/p> <p>Davie had to tighten his belt in taking the top role, agreeing to Hall\u2019s salary until mid-2021, when it rose to \u00a3525,000.<\/p> <p>He was also chair of Comic Relief, a role he relinquished before becoming director general. <\/p> <p>His time as BBC director general was marked by several high-profile controversies including the brief suspension of Match of the Day host Gary Lineker in 2023.<\/p> <p>The former England footballer was suspended after posting a tweet comparing the language used to launch a new government asylum seeker policy with 1930s Germany.<\/p> <p>Davie faced pressure after a host of sports presenters and pundits pulled out of BBC shows over the suspension, but defended the decision.<\/p> <p>Upon Lineker\u2019s return, Davie announced there would be an independent review into the BBC\u2019s social media guidelines and apologised for a \u201cdifficult period for staff, contributors, presenters, and most importantly, our audiences\u201d.<\/p> <p>In recent months, the BBC has faced numerous controversies including the livestreaming of Bob Vylan\u2019s performance at Glastonbury where the punk rappers led chants of \u201cdeath, death to the IDF\u201d [Israel Defense Forces], as well as misconduct allegations surrounding the former MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace.<\/p> <p>Last month, the communications watchdog Ofcom imposed sanctions on the BBC for breaching the broadcasting code over its Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone documentary after the corporation failed to disclose a narrator\u2019s links to Hamas.<\/p> <p>Davie joined the BBC from Pepsi, where he was responsible for European marketing, including the decision to colour a Concorde and the Daily Mirror Pepsi blue for a campaign. <\/p> <p>Davie joined Pepsi in 1993 after cutting his teeth as a marketer at Procter &amp; Gamble, which hired him while he was studying English at Cambridge.<\/p> <p>Born in 1967, he was privately educated at Whitgift school in South Croydon, which he attended after winning a scholarship.<\/p> <p>Davie also served as an executive board member of the European Broadcasting Union, the world\u2019s leading alliance of public service media organisations. He was also trustee of both the Tate and the Royal Television Society, as well as a former co-chair of the Creative Industries Council.<\/p> <p>He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2018 for services to international trade.<\/p>"

It was an extraordinary drive, even as Lando Norris delivered a perfect weekend with a win at Interlagos and in so doing stake a claim to having one hand on the title.<\/p> <p>Norris\u2019s victory was without doubt that of a champion in waiting as he managed a tense and high\u2011pressure victory from pole position to extend his world championship lead over his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri, who finished fifth. Norris gave a performance of precision and control exactly when it was required to put real daylight on his two title rivals.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2025\/nov\/09\/lewis-hamilton-laments-nightmare-first-season-driving-for-ferrari\">Lewis Hamilton laments \u2018nightmare\u2019 first season driving for Ferrari<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>Yet Verstappen, as ever, was irrepressible at the Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace,where he drove from 17th to victory last season and is now the scene of two of his best drives. With Verstappen and Red Bull having found the pace that eluded them all weekend after taking a new engine and employing a new setup after a dire qualifying, he scythed through the field with verve and dash that was a joy to watch.<\/p> <p>Every opening he went for he made, even as he made three pit stops, including an early one for a slow puncture. He had to come back from 19th at the start then 18th after his first stop and yet his rise through the field felt positively inexorable.<\/p> <p>Norris matched him with the controlled drive required to convert his pole and in so doing now has the whip hand. After scoring the maximum possible points with victories in both the sprint and the GP, Norris has a 24\u2011point advantage over Piastri while Verstappen is 49 points behind, with 83 points still to race for in the final three meetings, Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.<\/p> <p>The turnaround for Norris, with his seventh victory this season, has been extraordinary since he was 34 points behind Piastri after the Dutch GP in August \u2013 a period when his credentials as a world champion and whether he had the steel to fight for it were being questioned. They were opinions he felt he had answered emphatically when asked on the reasons for his recent form.<\/p> <p>\u201cJust ignore everyone who talks crap about you and focus on yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a long way to go but it can change so quickly, like we\u2019ve seen today. So, just focus on myself, keep my head down, ignore everyone and keep pushing.\u201d<\/p>    <p>For all that Verstappen played centre stage with a captivating soliloquy, Norris\u2019s performance drives the narrative: a decisive moment in the title race given that Piastri endured another blow to his title hopes. Starting from fourth he took an early 10\u2011second penalty for causing a collision when he locked up and hit Kimi Antonelli at turn one. Although he delivered a strong performance to recover, the damage was done.<\/p> <p>Piastri might feel aggrieved that he was not at fault as he made a legitimate move up the inside and that Antonelli had not given him enough space, but he has been on the back foot all weekend. He crashed out in the sprint race while Norris completed the full monty of pole and victory in both disciplines.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https:\/\/interactive.guim.co.uk\/embed\/iframe-wrapper\/0.1\/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https:\/\/interactive.guim.co.uk\/embed\/from-tool\/numbered-list\/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Formula%20One%20driver%20standings&amp;standfirst=After%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Grand%20Prix&amp;number-1=390pts&amp;field-1=Lando%20Norris%2C%20McLaren&amp;number-2=366&amp;field-2=Oscar%20Piastri%2C%20McLaren&amp;number-3=341&amp;field-3=Max%20Verstappen%2C%20Red%20Bull&amp;number-4=276&amp;field-4=George%20Russell%2C%20Mercedes&amp;number-5=214&amp;field-5=Charles%20Leclerc%2C%20Ferrari&amp;number-6=&amp;field-6=&amp;number-7=&amp;field-7=&amp;number-8=&amp;field-8=\" data-alt=\"Drivers\u2019 standings\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/interactive.guim.co.uk\/embed\/from-tool\/numbered-list\/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=Formula%20One%20driver%20standings&standfirst=After%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Grand%20Prix&number-1=390pts&field-1=Lando%20Norris%2C%20McLaren&number-2=366&field-2=Oscar%20Piastri%2C%20McLaren&number-3=341&field-3=Max%20Verstappen%2C%20Red%20Bull&number-4=276&field-4=George%20Russell%2C%20Mercedes&number-5=214&field-5=Charles%20Leclerc%2C%20Ferrari&number-6=&field-6=&number-7=&field-7=&number-8=&field-8=\">Interactive<\/a> <\/figure>  <p>After taking pole on Saturday Norris had acknowledged that he had addressed weaknesses in his performances this season and noticeably was now expressing a quiet confidence in how he was driving. Norris can, self\u2011admittedly, be a glass half-empty character, unafraid of self-criticism \u2013 so that he now feels he really is on top of his game is telling and was manifest from his control in a tough test in Brazil.<\/p> <p>Norris not only enjoys the lead but, it appears, the same calm assurance Piastri held when he dominated in the early part of the season. As the race ebbed and flowed, a complex challenge marked by varying tyre strategies was made all the more intriguing by Verstappen barrelling about as an excitable stallion as he advanced on the leaders, the McLaren pit wall and Norris having to factor in a Red Bull that has looked all but irrelevant Saturday afternoon.<\/p> <p>Having opted to take the penalty and start Verstappen from the pit lane in an effort to address the setup issues which had left him struggling so badly, Red Bull\u2019s boldness paid off. His pace at times was fearsome, up to a second and half up on Norris, who insisted the world champion remained a player in the title race.<\/p> <p>\u201cWith how quick he was today, he probably would have won if he started higher up.\u201d he said, \u201cHe will be a threat, he always is, he is always fighting and will fight to the end. When asked if he could have covered Verstappen\u2019s pace in a straight fight, he gave an unequivocal \u201cno\u201d.<\/p> <p>It is nonetheless Norris who holds all the cards now, but Verstappen demonstrated in striking fashionhe really is not quite ready to forget this championship quite yet.<\/p> <p>Kimi Antonelli took a superb career-best second for Mercedes, with his teammate George Russell in fourth and Haas\u2019s Ollie Bearman an excellent sixth. Lewis Hamilton endured another disappointing race, forced to retire his Ferrari after taking floor damage in the opening laps.<\/p>"

                    "headline": "Kingdom review \u2013 David Attenborough never fails to make nature awe-inspiring",
                    "body": "<p>As I watch a leopard hunt in Kingdom, the BBC\u2019s latest David Attenborough-narrated documentary, I find myself thinking about a <a href=\"https:\/\/yougov.co.uk\/politics\/articles\/24402-half-britons-wouldnt-want-go-moon-even-if-their-sa\">YouGov survey<\/a> from a few years ago that found that half of Britons wouldn\u2019t take a free trip to the moon, with 11% turning it down because \u201cthere isn\u2019t enough to see and do\u201d. As well as it providing a fantastic insight into the great British public\u2019s psyche (would outer space be better if it had Alton Towers?), I can\u2019t help but wonder if it also explains the pressure that TV commissioners feel under to find new ways to interest the pesky human race in sights that would previously have been greeted with wonder.<\/p> <p>Back in 2017, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2017\/nov\/06\/blue-planet-ii-years-most-watched-tv-show-david-attenborough?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">Blue Planet II<\/a> was the most-watched programme of the year, with 14.1 million viewers tuning in to see dolphins surf on prime time. Today, the six-part Kingdom has been bumped to the teatime slot, and finding out which Strictly celeb\u2019s rumba has been voted the most mediocre is deemed more important to the schedule.<\/p> <p>Still, it is not as if Attenborough, and the enormous team behind him, have stopped trying. Billed by the BBC as \u201cone of the most ambitious projects\u201d ever undertaken by its Natural History Unit, Kingdom was filmed over the course of five years and has an impressive scope. But it focuses on the lives of four African animal families \u2013 leopards, hyenas, wild dogs and lions \u2013 as they jostle for dominance in a fertile river valley in Zambia.<\/p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uKzjZu_KVzU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/uKzjZu_KVzU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ><\/iframe> <\/figure>   <p>It is essentially Game of Thrones if Cersei was a hyena and everyone was competing for some dinner. Watching the opening title sequence, in which images of the various animal dynasties are superimposed over a map of their territory, you half expect Sean Bean\u2019s face to pop up on the northern border.<\/p> <p>Winter is coming! No, sorry, that\u2019s some leopards. We are introduced to Olimba, undisputed queen of the valley for a decade, who is teaching her son Moyo, and daughter, Mutima, about danger at the local mud bath. As Moyo \u2013 courageous but quite daft \u2013 wanders through the water oblivious to a hippopotamus camouflaged beneath, Mutima looks on from the sidelines with a stare many sisters will recognise. Disaster is averted this time (we\u2019re only 11 minutes in, after all) but the producers may as well hold up a sign that reads \u201cFORESHADOWING\u201d. Viewers with a sensitive disposition should not get attached to Moyo\/Jon Snow.<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Shots of elephants, giraffes and zebras congregating at the river are striking. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re spying on utopia<\/p> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>As we watch Olimba hunt to feed her cubs, new arrival Storm \u2013 a wild dog and rival queen \u2013 enters with her pack stage left to get the prey for herself. Outnumbered, Olimba has no choice but to hide from the dogs in a treetop; a humbling sight for such a majestic creature.<\/p> <p>If you\u2019re siding with the leopards at this point, nature conveniently provides a plot twist. As Storm enjoys her feast, hyenas \u2013 a species typically twice the size of wild dogs \u2013 turn up to try to steal her spoils. Suddenly you find yourself swapping allegiances. Team Wild Dog! But also Team Leopard.<\/p> <p>Saying that, I can only respect pregnant hyena Tandala. While her family are off nabbing prey, she keeps out of the drama, sunbathing by the water with her eyes half shut. Anthropomorphism risks aside, by the time Tandala is hiding her snack in the river to keep it away from her annoying relatives, you can\u2019t help but see your mum storing the Celebrations under the bed because your dad won\u2019t stop eating the Maltesers Teasers.<\/p>    <p>Wildlife shows often spotlight the innate quest for survival, and Kingdom puts it at the forefront. But the shots of supporting characters \u2013 from elephants and giraffes to zebras \u2013 congregating at the river are some of the most striking, as if we are spying on utopia.<\/p> <p>The third act brings another pack to threaten the leopard\u2019s reign, and with it, the most emotive scene of the hour. When Moyo goes missing, Olimba searches day and night for her son. By morning, Moyo has been found dead, his wounds likely caused by a lion.<\/p> <p>We have been privileged to see much of this before. And yet that\u2019s the thing about the Attenborough franchise in 2025. No matter how many times viewers have watched similar chains of events, it is still deeply moving to hear a mother call for her child and know he is not coming back.<\/p> <p>The episode ends with a cliffhanger, when Storm\u2019s new litter are surrounded by a group of lions. Seven puppies hide in a den but one is left behind. Attenborough teases the next episode: \u201cCan Storm rescue her pup in time or will it have to face the lions alone?\u201d<\/p> <p>Repetitive? Perhaps. Awe-inspiring, exhilarating and affecting? Certainly.<\/p> <p>\u2022 Kingdom aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now in the UK, and will air on the Nine Network in Australia at a later date<\/p>"

That\u2019s the good news; the bad news is that only one of them \u2013 tops \u2013 can do it. City and Liverpool seem to be hitting their stride after dodgy spells earlier in the season. City have won 10 of the last 13 in all competitions; Liverpool ended their slump with defiant victories over Aston Villa and Real Madrid.<\/p> <p>They kept clean sheets in both games, too. That won\u2019t be so easy against Erling Haaland, the red wine of any contemporary clean sheet metaphor. Haaland is in rampant form, with 10 goals in his last six games at the Etihad, and has gone to another level this season. He was vaguely competent beforehand.<\/p> <p><strong>Kick off <\/strong>4.30pm.<\/p> <\/div>   <\/div>"

That business merged with Shop Direct in 2004. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2021\/jan\/13\/daily-telegraph-owner-sir-david-barclay-dies-unexpectedly-at-86\">David Barclay died in 2021<\/a>.<\/p> <p>However, the Barclay family\u2019s fortunes appear to have worsened in recent years. They <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2023\/jun\/08\/how-the-barclay-empire-lost-its-grip-on-the-daily-telegraph\">lost control of the Telegraph newspapers<\/a> after the family struggled to repay large loans.<\/p> <p>Carlyle first became a lender to the Very Group in 2021 with a loan of undisclosed size. The investor followed that up in 2024 with about \u00a385m out of a \u00a3125m debt package. Carlyle\u2019s total financing to the business is thought to be more than \u00a3500m.<\/p> <p>Abu Dhabi-based investment fund International Media Investments (IMI), which also lent to Very, is expected to remain a lender.<\/p> <p>Very itself is not thought to be struggling financially. The retailer last month reported increased profitability, with \u00a3307m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in the year to 28 June. It made sales of \u00a32.1bn in the year.<\/p> <p>The Very Group and Carlyle both declined to comment.<\/p>"

It was Manchester City who cleared their throats and made it plain that they are in this race for the long haul. Liverpool barely got a word in.<\/p> \n<p>The table looks a lot more appealing for Pep Guardiola and his players now, City only four points behind Arsenal, and it was an occasion when they blew Liverpool away. They could shrug off the inconvenience of Erling Haaland missing a controversially awarded 13th-minute penalty to put on a show of strength, particularly in the first half.<\/p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2025\/nov\/09\/manchester-city-3-0-liverpool-premier-league-player-ratings\">Manchester City 3-0 Liverpool: Premier League player ratings<\/a> <\/p> \n<\/aside> \n<p>It was Haaland, inevitably, who opened the scoring with his 19th City goal of the season and, after Nico Gonz\u00e1lez had benefited from a deflection off Virgil van Dijk in first-half stoppage time, the scene was set for the coup de grace.<\/p> \n<p>J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku was almost unplayable, a blur of tricks and direct running and his goal for 3-0 was a beauty, a quick move inside before the perfectly executed curler with his right foot into the far corner. He merited the ovation he got when he was substituted towards the end.<\/p> \n<p>Liverpool cried foul over two decisions \u2013 both driven by the video assistant referee, Michael Oliver. They got away with the penalty when Giorgi Mamardashvili kept out Haaland\u2019s kick but the sickener was when Van Dijk had a header for 1-1 ruled out after a corner. Andy Robertson was in an offside position close to Gianluigi Donnarumma and it mattered not that the City goalkeeper looked unlikely to make the save. It was a real letter of the law call.<\/p> \n<p>It was not the reason why Liverpool lost. City were slicker and more incisive; they carried the greater physical threat, too. It was difficult not to fear that Liverpool\u2019s title defence has ended here and not only because they trail Arsenal by eight points. It was the manner in which they fell to a fourth away league defeat in succession for the first time since 2012. There had been no little fanfare after their midweek Champions League <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2025\/nov\/04\/liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report\">win over Real Madrid<\/a>. They were back. Not on this evidence.<\/p> \n<p>Guardiola was lauded for his 1,000th game as a manager beforehand, City screening an extended and effusive tribute to him on the big screen, and it was then on to trying to unpick another of his tactical setups. Because the fluency, the positional interchanges of his midfielders, was really something.<\/p> \n<p>City brought intensity from the first whistle, Doku marauding from the left, popping up all over. Bernardo Silva sat alongside Gonz\u00e1lez one minute and pushed high or wide the next. He would control the tempo. Guardiola consistently seemed to have the extra man in midfield. Nico O\u2019Reilly caused problems from left-back when he was not doing a defensive number on Mohamed Salah.<\/p> \n<p>The touchpaper was lit by the penalty decision, the referee, Chris Kavanagh, advised by Oliver to study the replays of the moment when Doku appeared to bulldoze through Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 before slicing back from the byline and seeing Mamardashvili come flying out at him. The contact was minimal \u2013 one of those where you had to look very hard from a specific angle to discover it \u2013 and, if it was technically there, it did not disguise the reality that the award was soft.<\/p> \n<p>City did not relent after Mamardashvili\u2019s save. Doku shimmered with menace. It was the skills, the pace, the strength; the complete package. Rayan Cherki had a shot blocked by Konat\u00e9 and the breakthrough had been advertised. Liverpool were in danger of being run off the pitch. It was remarkable to see how many one-on-one duels they lost before the interval; how they plodded without inspiration.<\/p> \n<p>Haaland\u2019s goal for 1-0 was strange, albeit the buildup was lovely. Konat\u00e9 appeared to get a little flick to Matheus Nunes\u2019s cross from the right with Haaland airborne behind him. But the striker still managed to loop the header back into the corner of the net. How much did he know about it? Then again, it was Haaland.<\/p> \n<p>Slot raged on the touchline when the Van Dijk lifeline was snuffed out \u2013 the Liverpool captain bullied Nunes to thump home his header \u2013 and the wound was salted when Gonz\u00e1lez tried his luck from distance. The ball just had to take a decisive flick off Van Dijk.<\/p> \n<p>Slot had stuck with his back-to-basics approach, the same lineup \u2013 broadly \u2013 that he played in the victories against Aston Villa and Real that had given Liverpool optimism in the buildup. The key detail was that it was the midfield three from the title-winning season last time out, with Florian Wirtz on the left of the front three. Wirtz had a few flickers, City having to resort to some roughhouse stuff to stop him.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"17c660cc-0f15-4405-8487-4c0d38de4383\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>The Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/info\/2025\/sep\/29\/upgrade-your-downtime-with-guardian-puzzles\">the launch of its first daily football game<\/a>, On the ball.

Ryan Gravenberch almost released Salah, R\u00faben Dias forced into a saving challenge as Donnarumma made a reckless bolt from his area. Gonz\u00e1lez nearly put through his own goal while Cody Gakpo, on as a substitute for the anonymous Hugo Ekitik\u00e9, blazed over when well placed.<\/p> \n<p>Doku kept coming. He enjoyed himself, the alarm bells ringing for Liverpool whenever he got on the ball. His goal was the showstopper. Dominik Szoboszlai would work Donnarumma with a piledriver while Salah touched narrowly wide of the far corner in a one-on-one. The game was long since over.<\/p>"

The long Scandinavian winter, which typically stretches from November until late March, demands layers of clothing and plenty of protection against the cold. While temperatures can plummet to -30C (-22F) farther north in Sweden and Norway, winters farther south in Sweden, Norway and Denmark tend to be milder and wetter, requiring breathable materials that also withstand rain.<\/p> <p>Moving abroad to the UK and then returning to Sweden, I realized how underdressed people were outside Scandinavia. It became even more obvious after having kids and noticing how we always try to dress them appropriately, including several layers of clothing that are finished off with a pair of thick shell pants.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/thefilter-us\/2025\/nov\/04\/best-nostalgic-gift-ideas\">Fifteen nostalgic gifts in the US that will take you back to simpler times<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>To help non-Scandinavians and Scandinavians alike dress fearlessly for the chilly months ahead, I\u2019ve gathered eight favourite products you\u2019ll spot on the streets and slopes across the Nordic region right now.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve honed these insights writing about lifestyle topics, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fashion\">fashion<\/a>, for 15 years.

The company says these are made up of millions of encapsulated air bubbles that make them ideal for cold conditions. Originally a favourite among nature enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a go-to for city dwellers in recent years.

In Finland, the wool base layer is a winter essential, especially in cold and wet conditions, since wool retains heat even when damp. For Werneri Varhanen, founder of a clothing brand in Helsinki, that typically means wool as a base, then fleece, followed by a winter jacket or light puffer, topped with a waterproof and windproof shell. \u201cThat way, you can adjust to a variety of temperatures and conditions just by adding or removing a layer,\u201d he says. \u201cFor wool base layers, a personal favourite \u2013 and quite popular here \u2013 is the New Zealand brand <a href=\"https:\/\/eu.icebreaker.com\/sv-se\/collections\/mens-baselayers\">Icebreaker<\/a>. But I also like Norway\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.devold.com\/sv-se\/lauparen-merino-190-base-shirt-man-1533b07f\/?color=284A&amp;size=L\">Devold<\/a>.\u201d<\/p> <h2>Half-finger gloves<\/h2>    <p><strong>Unisex<\/strong><\/p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hestragloves.us\/basic-wool-half-finger-grey\" > $45 at Hestra <\/a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hestra-Basic-Wool-Finger-Glove\/dp\/B081FCZ79K?th=1&amp;psc=1\" > $44.95 at Amazon <\/a>  <p>The half-finger glove, also called the \u201cmarket glove\u201d, was originally designed to make it easier to handle goods and money at outdoor markets in cold conditions, when fingers needed to stay free. Denmark\u2019s mild winters, combined with Copenhagen\u2019s bike-friendly streets, have made them popular for a different reason \u2013 allowing an active lifestyle while staying warm (and stylish). Danes ride year-round \u2013 and their wardrobes reflect it. Clothes need to be practical and functional, yet never at the expense of looking good. \u201cThe bike culture is huge here and in the last few years the winters haven\u2019t been as cold as they usually are,\u201d says Teodora Kolchagova, a brand and communications manager in Copenhagen. \u201cI love the half-finger gloves \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hestragloves.us\/basic-wool-half-finger-grey\">Hestra<\/a> does really nice ones in wool.\u201d<\/p> <h2>Long puffer jacket<\/h2>    <p>The long <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fashion\/winter-coats\">puffer jacket<\/a> has faced some undeserved ridicule in Sweden in recent years for its bulky shape and supposed lack of style. Often nicknamed the \u201cmother sausage\u201d, it\u2019s commonly spotted on mothers with young babies out on stroller walks. While Swedish fashion journalist Samanda Ekman argues that the coat represents \u201canti-fashion\u201d, author Johanna Schreiber sees it as a symbol of \u201cwomen\u2019s liberation\u201d. The coat\u2019s popularity is easy to understand: filled with down, it\u2019s loved for its cocoon-like warmth. \u201cIt\u2019s like wearing a duvet,\u201d says Nina Lindesv\u00e4rd, an engineer in Stockholm, who wears a black long puffer from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.samsoe.com\/en-SE\/product\/sahanadi-puffer-coat-15701-black\">Sams\u00f8e Sams\u00f8e<\/a>. \u201cIt\u2019s also great for wearing with a skirt underneath \u2013 or the opposite: sweatpants for a grocery run, and no one will notice. In general, I don\u2019t like coats that don\u2019t cover my behind.\u201d While Lindesv\u00e4rd\u2019s jacket is only available for women, Rains does an excellent version for both women and men (my husband has one).<\/p> <p><strong>Men\u2019s<\/strong><\/p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.us.rains.com\/products\/long-puffer-jacket-male?variant=42074489683991\" > $550 at Rains <\/a>  <p><strong>Women\u2019s<\/strong><\/p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.us.rains.com\/collections\/puffer-jackets-women\/products\/long-puffer-jacket-female?intl=&amp;variant=42074488668183\" > $550 at Rains <\/a>  <h2>Heated socks<\/h2>    <p><strong>Unisex<\/strong><\/p> <p><strong>Non-compression version on Amazon, batteries included:<\/strong><\/p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/amazon.com\/dp\/B0BLZNT6LY\" > $444.95 at Amazon <\/a>  <p><strong>Compression version on Amazon, batteries included:<\/strong><\/p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/amazon.com\/dp\/B0BLZMWJNW\" > $479.94 at Amazon <\/a>  <p>The most traditional Scandinavian sock is the hand-knitted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fashion\/2025\/aug\/02\/darn-tough-socks-worth-it-buy-it-for-life\">wool sock<\/a>, worn either on its own or layered over another sock inside shoes. Many families have someone who makes them, but if bought, they usually come from flea markets or directly from local makers.

The pedestrian safety reflector, originally invented by Arvi Lehti in Pertteli, Finland, in 1963, is incredibly common. You\u2019ll see them clipped to jackets and bags everywhere, especially since it gets dark so early in winter. According to the Finnish Road Safety Council, a person is normally visible in car headlights at 50 metres (165ft), but with a reflector, visibility increases to 350 metres (1,150ft). \u201cIt\u2019s a typical Finnish thing \u2013 a little plastic piece you attach to your sleeve, in its most classic form, so you can be seen in the dark,\u201d says Elna Nyk\u00e4nen Andersson, a Finnish native now working as a diplomatic counsellor based in Tokyo. \u201cThere are loads of different designs, but I wear the classic snowflake.\u201d<\/p> <p>I haven\u2019t been able to find this exact snowflake design on sale in the US, but based on my research this is a close contender.<\/p> <h2>Allv\u00e6rsjakke \u2013 the \u2018all-weather jacket\u2019<\/h2>    <p><strong>Women\u2019s<\/strong><\/p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fjallraven.com\/us\/en-us\/women\/jackets\/parkas\/hc-hydratic-padded-parka-w\/ \" > $530 at Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven <\/a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rei.com\/product\/249802\/fjallraven-hc-hydratic-padded-parka-womens\" > $530 at REI <\/a>  <p><strong>Men\u2019s<\/strong><\/p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/houdinisportswear.com\/en-us\/clothing\/jackets\/mens-fall-in-parka-248514?color=248514G54 \" > $800 at Houdini Sportswear <\/a>  <p>Norway is known for its strong hiking culture, which has also shaped its outdoor fashion.

Originally a simple raincoat or anorak, it has evolved into a more technical garment, such as a parka, perfect for unpredictable weather. \u201cI love that it\u2019s waterproof and lined, so it\u2019s warm and can handle all kinds of weather,\u201d says Oslo-based journalist Vibeke Stiansen, who recommends these parkas from Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven (for women) and Houdini (for men). And like many Scandinavians, she layers underneath it. \u201cI would typically wear a basic T-shirt or shirt with jeans or tailored trousers, and then a lovely knitted jumper on top \u2013 either a short one in cashmere or merino wool, or a long, oversized style, preferably in wool or a mohair blend,\u201d she says.<\/p> <h2>Balaclava<\/h2>    <p><strong>Women\u2019s<\/strong><\/p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/bymalina.com\/us\/p\/brielle-balaclava-taupe\/\" > $155 at Malina <\/a>  <p><strong>Men\u2019s<\/strong><\/p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cos.com\/en-us\/men\/accessories\/hatsscarvesgloves\/cashmere\/product\/cashmere-balaclava-black-mlange-1309740001\" > $139 at Cos <\/a>  <p>This hat, which covers large parts of the head and face, has become a fashion statement. \u201cI love my balaclavas,\u201d says Stockholm-based Sara Brandt Zaric, a communications professional, who owns three versions \u2013 and recommends this one from Malina (for women) and Cos (for men).

It keeps you warm without any gaps, protecting against both snow and wind. And you don\u2019t lose it if you pull it back off your head.

The outlet says the emails were recently shared with the House Judiciary Committee.<\/p> <p>\u201cMy situation is improved by being at Bryan,\u201d she wrote in one email. In another, she wrote: \u201cThe institution is run in an orderly fashion which makes for a safer more comfortable environment for all people concerned, inmates and guards alike.\u201d<\/p> <p>Maxwell described the living conditions, stating that the kitchen \u201clooks clean too \u2013&nbsp;no possums falling from the celling to fry unfortunately on ovens, and become mingled with the food being served\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cI feel like I have dropped through Alice in Wonderlands looking glass,\u201d Maxwell wrote in an email to a relative. \u201cI am much much happier here and more importantly safe.\u201d<\/p> <p>The food, she said, was \u201clegions better\u201d than where she was held previously. \u201cThe place is clean, the staff responsive and polite \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen or heard the usual foul language or screaming accompanied by threats leveled at inmates by anyone,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI have not seen a single fight, drug deal, passed out person or naked inmate running around or several of them congregating in a shower!\u201d<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/nov\/04\/jamie-raskin-justice-department-epstein-investigation\">House Democrat accuses Trump\u2019s DoJ of \u2018gigantic cover-up\u2019 over shut Epstein inquiry<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>NBC also reported that in other emails, Maxwell praised the prison camp warden as a \u201ctrue professional\u201d and also complained about \u201cpeople selling rubbish stories and making money from their lies\u201d.<\/p> <p>The emails were reportedly shared with the House judiciary committee after Maryland representative Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the committee, <a href=\"https:\/\/democrats-judiciary.house.gov\/sites\/evo-subsites\/democrats-judiciary.house.gov\/files\/evo-media-document\/2025-10-30-raskin-to-hall-fpcbryan-re-maxwell-1.pdf\">sent a letter<\/a> to the warden of the Texas facility on 30 October.

Their present form is in stark contrast to that of 12 months ago when England were mired in a run of six defeats in seven games, all by narrow margins. Three of those losses were inflicted by New Zealand \u2013 two on the 2024 summer tour before a 24\u201122 defeat at Twickenham after George Ford missed two late kicks at goal.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2025\/nov\/08\/scotland-new-zealand-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report\">New Zealand edged out Scotland<\/a> on Saturday to keep alive the All Blacks\u2019 hopes of a home nations grand slam and, though the Springboks cemented their spot at the top of the rankings by beating France, George has heralded New Zealand as \u201carguably the best side in the world\u201d. Of the past 11 meetings, England\u2019s only win against New Zealand came in the 2019 World Cup semi-final and the All Blacks have not been beaten in the past five games at Twickenham.<\/p> <p>\u201cWhat a lot of teams do is sit back in awe of the All Blacks with their history and all their incredible players,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to do that. I\u2019ve probably done it. We\u2019ve also got to be aware we\u2019ll be back here at Allianz Stadium. We\u2019re very proud to be playing here. We are going to do everything we can to win that game.<\/p> <p>\u201cYou have to be at your best. New Zealand are arguably the best side in the world at the minute. They\u2019re an unbelievably fantastic team and they seem to step up a gear when they come to Allianz Stadium.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe important thing for us to do is work out where we could have been better in the first half this week. But also have a clear gameplan which can put them under as much pressure as we possibly can. If we do that, we\u2019ll give ourselves a chance.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe came under a bit of heat 12 months ago for not coming out on the right side of tight games and not finding a way to win. Now we\u2019re doing the exact opposite. By no means have we cracked it. But we\u2019ve placed a big emphasis on the latter stages of games and closing games out. Scoring however many tries in the last quarter of that game is a sign of a good team.\u201d<\/p> <p>Borthwick is again expected to make a number of changes to his side with the captain, Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Ford all expected to return to the starting lineup. Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi\u2011Waboso were both in the wars against Fiji but have been selected in the squad to face the All Blacks.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe want to challenge ourselves against the best teams and [New Zealand] are one of those best teams,\u201d Borthwick said. \u201cWe\u2019re a young side, we\u2019re developing, I think we\u2019re growing quickly and we\u2019re keen to learn. So I\u2019m sure next week\u2019s going to be a great assessment for us.\u201d<\/p> <p>Ben Earl, meanwhile, believes that England\u2019s present ability to pull clear in the closing stages of matches owes much to their three narrow defeats by New Zealand last year. \u201cYou feel battle-hardened, you feel like you\u2019ve got the wounds, you\u2019ve got the scar tissue to learn from those losses, and they hurt at the time,\u201d said Earl, who was named man of the match against Fiji.<\/p> <p>\u201cBut I wonder, to a man in the changing room, would we have changed our journey now, with the joy that we\u2019re sometimes enjoying now? I\u2019d be interested to know because I think they\u2019re very, very valuable lessons.\u201d<\/p>"

The area around Coranderrk, an Aboriginal reserve established by the Victorian government in 1863, which still regarded as a key site of self-determination, would also be recognised under the claim filed with the federal court on Friday.<\/p>    <p>It comes one week after Victoria became the first Australian state to pass into law a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/australia-news\/2025\/oct\/31\/australia-first-formal-treaty-indigenous-traditional-owners-passed-victoria\">formal treaty with Aboriginal people<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Di Kerr, a Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung elder, said the process was about \u201censuring our connection to country is recognised in law, as it has always existed in truth\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very proud that this process is happening, and we want to walk together,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be separate. We want to have partnerships with governments and Parks Victoria so we can co-manage and look after that country.\u201d<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton\"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email<\/sub><\/a><\/p> <p>If successful, it would be the eighth native title determination to be granted in Victoria and the third that covers a capital city. The Kaurna people were recognised as native title holders over Adelaide in 2018, after an 18-year battle; and the Noongar native title settlement in Western Australia covers the entire south-west corner of the state, including Perth.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/australia-news\/2025\/oct\/31\/australia-first-formal-treaty-indigenous-traditional-owners-passed-victoria\">Australia\u2019s first formal treaty with Indigenous traditional owners passed in Victoria<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>Filing the application with the federal court is an early step in what can often be a decades-long process. If native title were granted, it would recognise the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung\u2019s rights to access, use and protect land in line with their laws and customs, along with the right to be consulted. <\/p> <p>Native title is only applied to crown land and does not affect private homes, businesses or public infrastructure. As such it has limited scope within metropolitan areas.<\/p> <p>The Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people are hoping to negotiate the transfer of management, or involvement in the administration, of some parks and conservation areas within the claim area. These could include parts of the Dandenong Ranges, Bunyip state park, Wombat state forest and Lerderderg state park.<\/p> <p>There are six other native title applications before the federal court in Victoria, which collectively encompass most of the state.<\/p> <p>A Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung elder, Perry Wandin, said when native title claims were launched, \u201ceveryone thinks we\u2019re coming after their properties\u201d. But he said their aim was actually to work in conjunction with government and communities to look after and restore the land.<\/p> <p>\u201cWurundjeri people have fought for decades for recognition and respect and have been at the forefront of protecting culture and country in Melbourne and surrounds,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe courts have recognised seven other groups in Victoria.

In later life he published three books, including poetry and short stories, inspired by his experiences in the coalmining community.<\/p> <p>Born in Bulwell, Nottinghamshire, Gren, short for Granville, was the son of John, a miner, and Eliza. John died in a pit accident when Gren was four, and Eliza struggled to look after him and his five siblings. Experiencing hunger and cold as a child made him count his blessings as an adult, as he championed the rights of the less fortunate.<\/p> <p>At High Pavement school in Nottingham, Gren was thrown a lifeline by the headteacher\u2019s secretary, Mrs Gunn, who introduced him to Shakespeare and encouraged him to learn. Like most men in his community, after leaving school Gren worked in the mines, while raising a son with his first wife, Beryl, whom he married in 1954. A life-changing moment came when Gunn helped him secure an office job. In the mid-1960s he joined Thorn EMI as a clerk and worked his way up to manage the Rugby branch.<\/p> <p>In his spare time, Gren performed as a singer in pubs under the stage name Tony Firelli. A champion of leftwing causes and a Guardian reader, he became a Labour party member aged 18 and a Quaker later in life.<\/p> <p>After his retirement in 1994 and Beryl\u2019s death soon afterwards, he moved to Malvern, Worcestershire, where he met my mother, Arline Lillis, at a social history group of the University of the Third Age (U3A).<\/p> <p>They married in 2006 and had a lively social circle; Gren loved attending plays and concerts at Malvern theatre. He wrote three books, including Tales from the Golden Bull (2017), and chaired Malvern Writers\u2019 Circle, and the local branch of the U3A. He and Arline enjoyed travelling, with holidays in France, Spain, Italy, Norway, Turkey and Hungary, and even venturing as far afield as Kazakhstan. <\/p> <p>For the last few years Gren lived with Lewy body dementia, which he managed with characteristic fortitude.<\/p> <p>He is survived by Arline.<\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>For a while the mood was buoyant in Dagenham as <strong>West Ham<\/strong> fans felt their early season woes were finally lifting. Leading <strong>Leicester<\/strong> with four minutes to play, news filtered through that Liverpool had conceded a 93rd-minute equaliser to share the points with Brighton in a 1-1 draw. It meant that three points would lift the Hammers off the bottom of the Women\u2019s Super League for the first time this season.<\/p> <p>Rehanne Skinner\u2019s and Gareth Taylor\u2019s teams have been in lockstep and they somehow contrived to mirror each other once again. As their relegation rivals had done minutes earlier, the Hammers\u2019 conceded in the 97th minute to burst their supporters\u2019 bubble and drop two points in a 1-1 draw, ensuring the parity between the two continued.<\/p> <p>The two sides have been rooted to the bottom for the first seven weeks of the season, both losing all seven games, unable to find rewards despite improving performances, and their managers will be at a loss to as how their first wins of the season eluded them once again.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2025\/nov\/08\/renee-slegers-var-arsenal-chelsea-wsl\">\u2018We need justice\u2019: Slegers calls for VAR in WSL after Arsenal denied by officials<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>West Ham\u2019s campaign to date has been epitomised by an inability to take their chances and lapses of concentration. Both characteristics reared their heads again on this occasion against a Leicester side that offered little going forward but managed to remain in the game until the final moments.<\/p> <p>The Hammers\u2019 frontline has the potential to be very dangerous with the pace of Viviane Asseyi and Ffion Morgan, the instinct of Shekiera Martinez and the industry of Riko Ueki. They have, however, been plagued by a lack of clinical finishing. Chances presented themselves to all four of them throughout but it was only a scrappy finish from Martinez that put their noses in front.<\/p> <p>Danger always remains when the scoreline is that narrow and the Foxes made the hosts pay with almost the final kick of the match when the substitute Shannon O\u2019Brien snuck in at the far post to turn in Sari Kees\u2019s low ball.<\/p> <p><strong>Liverpool<\/strong>, meanwhile, earned their first point of the season against eighth-placed <strong>Brighton<\/strong>. <\/p> <p>Both sides have significant injury problems, particularly in attack. <\/p> <p>The Sweden striker Beata Olsson was handed another start by Taylor after she had impressed last week, scoring her first WSL goal. For the Seagulls, meanwhile, Dario Vidosic again opted for the 20-year-old Carla Camacho to lead the line in place of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2025\/oct\/30\/michelle-agyemang-injury-acl-rupture-england-arsenal-brighton\">Michelle Agyemang, who is out for the season<\/a>.<\/p> <p>It was arguably the best performance of Taylor\u2019s tenure as Liverpool took the game to Brighton, getting in behind the defence consistently. Olsson\u2019s first-half opener set them on their way. They proceeded to hit the woodwork twice \u2013 first Fuka Nagano and then Sam Kerr \u2013 while Faye Kirby had to be alert with a series of smart stops at the other end with the crossbar getting involved once again.<\/p> <p> Liverpool\u2019s hearts were broken, however, when Rosa Kafaji broke free in the box to strike deep into injury time.<\/p>    <p><strong>Manchester City<\/strong> went top of the table, leapfrogging Chelsea for the first time this season thanks to a hard-working 2-1 victory over <strong>Everton<\/strong>.<\/p> <p> Vivianne Miedema sent City ahead before a sublime finish from the Toffees\u2019 Kelly Gago levelled the score at Goodison Park.<\/p> <p>Bunny Shaw\u2019s towering second-half header proved enough to seal three points in spite of a strong fightback from Brian S\u00f8rensen\u2019s team who were denied by the post and some superb shot-stopping from Ayaka Yamashita.<\/p> <p><strong>London City Lionesses<\/strong> came through a six-goal thriller to consolidate their impressive start to the campaign and close the gap on fifth-place <strong>Tottenham<\/strong>.<\/p> <p>It was an eventful game at Bromley\u2019s Copperjax Community Stadium, that ended 4-2 to the hosts, as the momentum ebbed and flowed between the two.<\/p> <p>Freya Godfrey put in a player of the match performance, registering two goals and an assist. These were the 20-year-old\u2019s first goals since joining Jocelyn Pr\u00eacheur\u2019s side permanently from Arsenal.<\/p> <p>Spurs came from behind twice \u2013 Cathinka Tandberg cancelled out Godfrey\u2019s opener before Eveliina Summanen\u2019s sublime free-kick brought them level after Nikita Parris had put the hosts back in front.<\/p> <p>There was a lengthy stoppage for an injury to Tottenham\u2019s goalkeeper Lize Kop before the hosts opened up a two-goal advantage, first through an unfortunate Amanda Nild\u00e9n own goal and then Godfrey\u2019s second to seal the three points.<\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>What does the experience of women at the top tell us about the rest? Those most vulnerable to sexual harassment, assault and abuse are, unsurprisingly, those who have less power or are treated with less respect: undocumented migrants; women in precarious employment; women with disabilities; LGBTQ women; young women and girls.<\/p> <p>Paradoxically, that helps to explain why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2025\/nov\/05\/man-gropes-mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum\">the assault of Claudia Sheinbaum<\/a>, Mexico\u2019s president, has drawn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2025\/nov\/06\/mexicans-outraged-by-public-sex-assault-on-president\">such outrage<\/a> domestically and internationally. A drunken man tried to kiss her neck and grabbed her chest as she spoke to citizens in the capital\u2019s streets. It is the proof, captured on camera, that no woman is safe. You can be the most powerful person in the land and a man will still feel entitled to grope you, in front of the world, because you are a woman. When you object, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/world-nation\/story\/2025-11-05\/mexico-president-sheinbaum-sexual-harassment\">some will complain<\/a> that you are taking it too seriously, or that it is all made up. As Ms Sheinbaum herself remarked: \u201cIf they do this to the president, then what will happen to all the young women in our country?\u201d<\/p> <p>One in five girls and women in Mexico said they had experienced sexual violence in the community (as distinct from home, schools and workplaces) in the previous year, according to official figures from 2021. Ten women are killed each day. Ms Sheinbaum, like others, has noted the country\u2019s <em>machista<\/em> reputation previously. But the problem does not end there. In the US and the UK, surveys suggest four out of five women (and two out of five men) have experienced sexual harassment and assault. When those at the top are targeted, it sends a message to all women, and often deliberately so. Whatever their accomplishments \u2013 Ms Sheinbaum is also an environmental scientist who contributed to the reports of the Nobel peace prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2013 they can be reduced to their bodies.<\/p> <p>Julia Gillard, Australia\u2019s only female prime minister, was described as \u201cdeliberately barren\u201d. Kamala Harris has long faced explicitly sexual rhetorical attacks. When the then prime minister Theresa May met Nicola Sturgeon in 2017, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2017\/mar\/28\/daily-mail-legs-it-front-page-sexist\">the front page of the Daily Mail<\/a> asked of the two national leaders: \u201cNever mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!\u201d Politicians in general face an increasingly angry and violent political culture \u2013 in Mexico, many are killed each year \u2013 but women also face growing and more open sexism. The Reykjavik Index for Leadership, which measures perceptions in the G7 and Iceland, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.veriangroup.com\/en-gb\/news-and-insights\/the-reykjavik-index-for-leadership\">found<\/a> last year that in the US, less than half of respondents felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with the idea of a female political leader.<\/p> <p>Ms Sheinbaum is to be commended for pressing for charges and has rightly called for sexual harassment to be criminalised nationwide; many Mexican states have yet to do so. Yet, as mayor of Mexico City, when police cracked down on feminists demonstrating against gender-based violence,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amnesty.org\/en\/latest\/press-release\/2021\/03\/mexico-autoridades-usaron-violencia-sexual-para-silenciar-mujeres\/\"> she referred to the protests as \u201cprovocations\u201d<\/a>. Women\u2019s services have <a href=\"https:\/\/latinoamerica21.com\/en\/sheinbaum-a-feminist-dream-forgotten\/\">faced cuts<\/a> under her administration. That does not lessen the importance of her stand this week. But it demonstrates that female leadership does not inevitably benefit women at the bottom, whatever they have in common with those at the top. Expanded social security programmes, initiated under Ms Sheinbaum\u2019s predecessor,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/world\/article-claudia-sheinbaum-mexico-president-record-one-year-in-office\/\"> are already benefiting single mothers<\/a> and others. But the president should seize this opportunity to embrace Mexico\u2019s energetic grassroots feminist movement wholeheartedly, and work with it to tackle violence and misogyny, in the interests of all women.<\/p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "body": "<p>Like so many thousands of other young people of her generation, Rosalind Howells, who has died aged 94, left the Caribbean in 1951 with her head and heart filled with plans and dreams and intent upon her own hopes of a future possible professional career as a lawyer in Britain. Having arrived in London and recognised the grim everyday realities of inequality and discrimination that faced black people, she dedicated the rest of her life to doing something about it.<\/p> <p>She spent nearly half a century in south London working to improve the housing, education, health services and lifestyle of her community and then, on official \u201cretirement\u201d, went to the House of Lords in 1999. Tthe next 20 years she spent expounding her demands for equality to a wider audience, at Westminster and on international platforms in China, the Middle East and the US, seeking still to transform society and open the doors for others. <\/p> <p>She was not interested in rhetoric without reality, even less in tokenism. \u201cRepresentation means little if the door behind you is closed to others,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>Howells was tireless, forceful, loved and also feared. She could not say \u201cno\u201d to anyone who wanted help and would not accept \u201cno\u201d as an answer from the forces of authority. She wanted equality and justice for everyone, in the streets and in the courts, for the 13 young black people killed in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/jan\/17\/forty-years-on-from-the-new-cross-fire-what-has-changed-for-black-britons\">New Cross fire in 1981<\/a> and for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk\/lawrence\">Stephen Lawrence<\/a>, murdered in 1993. It was she who became a spokeswoman for the Lawrence family, who rattled on the doors of government for response and reaction.<\/p> <p>Her first job was in a public library, in Catford, south London, and she went back to college to train as a social worker. She worked for the London borough of Lewisham, helping young, single black mothers and then, in nearby Greenwich, she began confronting council policies across the range of social services. <\/p> <p>Most of her life was spent in community halls, classrooms, sports venues and committees, and her work was first recognised with appointment as OBE in 1994. She became the director of equal opportunities for the Greenwich Council for Racial Equality (1980-87) and she chaired the Lewisham Racial Equality Council (1994-97).<\/p> <p>Ros was born in St David, a parish in the south-east of Grenada, the daughter of Daphne George. She came to regard Joseph Gibbs, a primary school head teacher who was active in municipal politics, as her father. He was a one-time minister for communications and known universally as \u201cUncle Joe\u201d and in the family as \u201cPapa Joe\u201d. The family was staunchly Roman Catholic and Gibbs was appointed a papal knight. <\/p> <p>Ros was educated at St Joseph\u2019s convent from 1942 until 1949 and assisted in the school before taking a passage to the UK, accompanying a niece. The two girls hoped to emulate Ros\u2019s adopted sister, Hilda Gibbs (later Dame Hilda Bynoe), who had graduated as a doctor in London that year \u2013 and who would later, in 1968, become governor of Grenada, the first Grenadian in that post and the first female governor in the British Commonwealth. Howells would be made a Companion of the Order of Grenada in 2009.<\/p> <p>Growing up in Grenada, Howells had known from childhood that education was the first goal. \u201cEducation is freedom and power,\u201d she said once. \u201cAny investment in education is a good one.\u201d She was a governor of Avery Hill College for teacher training, which became part of Thames Polytechnic, and then the University of Greenwich (1985-97), and became the first female member of the court of governors of the university. <\/p> <p>She was appointed chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire (2009-14) and she was a board member of the Windward Islands research and education foundation, the research institute for St George\u2019s University in Grenada. She was a trustee of St George\u2019s UK Trust, of the Jason Roberts Foundation for sporting opportunities in the UK and Grenada, and of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust. <\/p> <p>At one stage, during a troubled period in Grenadian politics in the early 1980s, she served as Grenada\u2019s deputy high commissioner in London.<\/p> <p>Howells was the first black female member of the former Greater London Training Board, established by the Greater London council to develop learning programmes. She was a lifelong member of the Labour party and active across a range of organisations, including the former West Indian Standing Conference, an umbrella organisation formed in response to the 1958 Notting Hill riots and operational until 2000. <\/p> <p>She also worked with the Women of the Year committee and was a patron of Greenwich and Bexley hospice (2014-2016). In the Lords she was a member of the constitution committee (2001-04), the works of art committee (2009-14) and the social mobility committee (2015-16). She retired from the Lords in 2019.<\/p> <p>In 1955 she married John Howells, a librarian she met when working at Catford Library. They had two daughters, Anne and Amanda. John died in 2004 and Amanda in 2011. <\/p> <p>She is survived by Anne, two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.<\/p> <p><em>\u2022 <\/em>Rosalind Patricia-Anne Howells, Lady Howells of St Davids, community worker and politician, born 10 January 1931; died 14 October 2025 <\/p>"

                    "headline": "The Guardian view on Scottish land reform: vast estates remain feudal in scale",
                    "body": "<p>No other European country has such a narrow base of proprietorship as Scotland. Half of all privately owned rural land is <a href=\"https:\/\/andywightman.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/stage_one_briefing.pdf\">held<\/a> by 421 people or entities. The roots of such disparities lie in the past. The 18th- and 19th-century Highland clearances emptied the glens and readied them for private takeover. On the continent, and eventually in England, the great estates were broken up by inheritance and land taxes. By comparison, Scotland is still feudal in scale.<\/p> <p>The passing of a land reform bill, its supporters say, will change that. But doubts remain. Its proponents say the legislation could allow the Scottish government to intervene in private land sales and require large estates to be broken up. At its heart is the so-called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/articles\/cgr4d770znpo\">transfer test<\/a>. This would see Scottish ministers notified before any land sale over 1,000 hectares. However, they lack an explicit veto. If they wanted a more democratic constraint, they could have adopted the Scottish Land Commission\u2019s 2019 proposal for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.landcommission.gov.scot\/downloads\/5dd7d77021f04_Report-to-Ministers-Scale-and-Concentration-Land-Ownership-FINAL-20190320.pdf\">public interest test<\/a> \u2013 forcing big buyers to openly justify their purchases.<\/p> <p>Scottish ministers point out that by getting landowners to tell the government before any large-scale sale, they can give community groups a chance to put together a rival bid. But many big estates lie in sparsely populated upland areas where communities lack purchasing power. In theory, new \u201clotting\u201d rules in the bill could diversify ownership by potentially splitting large sales into smaller plots. Yet the land reform expert Andy Wightman <a href=\"https:\/\/andywightman.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/11\/stage3_briefing_2.pdf\">argues<\/a> that such powers will rarely be used \u2013 and even then, existing landowners can simply buy the lots back. Mr Wightman, a former Green MSP, argues persuasively that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk-news\/2024\/mar\/23\/land-ownership-in-rural-scotland-more-concentrated-despite-reforms-study-finds\">pattern of ownership<\/a> results from a free market in land which privileges those with the deepest pockets. His reasoning is that Scotland\u2019s land should be <a href=\"https:\/\/andywightman.scot\/2025\/08\/gresham-house-is-now-scotlands-2nd-largest-landowner\/\">regulated<\/a> as a shared resource in the public interest.<\/p> <p>Devolution has made this debate possible. Before 1999, Scottish land reform would have stalled in the Lords, where rich landlords literally sat in judgment. Despite more than a quarter of a century of argument, Scottish ministers are reluctant to adopt a more radical shake up.<\/p> <p>Craig Dalzell at the Common Weal thinktank suggests that a local <a href=\"https:\/\/revive.scot\/publication\/taxing-land-in-scotland\/\">land levy<\/a> would make hoarding costly and fund community investment. The same council powers were used for Scotland\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/articles\/cx25rjj0xy1o\">tourist tax<\/a>. Common Weal <a href=\"https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/66cdd4436533f0690e12c6c6\/t\/67d19acb38fad962d3ee3166\/1741789920313\/OUR+LAND+a+vision+for+land+reform+and+how+we+get+there.pdf\">argues<\/a> that Scotland should emulate Nordic nations, where smart taxes ensure smaller rural holdings. Significantly, they also encourage more sustainable patterns of forestry, farming and recreational use rather than absentee rents or speculation.<\/p> <p>Scottish land reform became a flashpoint in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.scot\/publications\/land-reform-review-group-final-report-land-scotland-common-good\/\">2014 independence campaign<\/a>, because it raised questions of power and sovereignty that drove the wider debate. Yet it was the ruling Scottish National party that last month voted down attempts by opposition MSPs to place a cap on the amount of land that a single entity could own unless they could meet strict limits. No doubt SNP ministers feared scaring off investment, particularly in forest land brought for carbon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-59592218\">offsetting<\/a>, or being accused of confiscatory nationalism.<\/p> <p>The Scottish government\u2019s reasoning \u2013 that ownership caps would be \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.commonweal.scot\/daily-briefings\/briefing-9p97y\">a gift to those who want to maintain the status quo<\/a>\u201d \u2013 got it backwards. By refusing caps, Holyrood preserved the status quo itself. How tightly Scotland retains old structures of land and power depends on whether its democracy has the courage to break the bond.<\/p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "body": "<p>It\u2019s hard to disagree with any of the sensible proposals in the Francis review (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/education\/2025\/nov\/04\/england-curriculum-should-focus-less-on-exams-and-more-on-life-skills-finds-review\">England curriculum should focus less on exams and more on life skills, finds review, 4 November<\/a>). My concern is with their modesty in such extreme times. Research has revealed that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naht.org.uk\/Portals\/0\/Images\/Campaigns\/NAHT%20Fixing%20the%20leadership%20crisis%20report%20(web).pdf?ver=2021-12-07-185308-070\">80% of headteachers in England<\/a> think their role has a negative impact on their quality of life, with many making plans to retire or leave the profession early. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lanplh\/article\/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3\/fulltext\">75% of 16- to 25-year-olds<\/a> describe the future as \u201cfrightening\u201d, with justified anxiety about climate breakdown prevalent. So why focus on trimming the sails rather than turning the wheel?<\/p> <p>The suggestion of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/education\/2025\/nov\/04\/national-curriculum-review-in-england-10-key-recommendations\">10% less GCSE exam time<\/a> and slightly reduced content is welcome. But as education is now compulsory until 18, why do we need GCSEs at all? Our teens spend more time preparing for exams than engaging in depth with the topics they cover, with a relentless prioritisation of targeted performance over broad intellectual, social and emotional development. A little more time on PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education) and sports is great, but not a solution. Teaching more about climate change without giving young people the skills and opportunities to take thoughtful, substantive action is likely to backfire, making them feel both responsible and powerless.<\/p> <p>The review we truly need would start by breaking a taboo: acknowledging that schooling\u2019s current structure aims to give individuals the chance to demonstrate their superior worth to others and be rewarded with limited higher-value positions in working life. Often euphemised as \u201csocial mobility\u201d, it lies in tatters as parental income continues to shape children\u2019s economic success. <\/p> <p>As the world continues to catch fire, that new review would set out new pragmatic and humane principles for our critical times \u2013 that cooperation, more than competition, will secure young people\u2019s futures, and that knowledge without the capacity to bring about change is a fast-devaluing currency.<\/p> <p>Curriculums that enable these principles already exist \u2013 many academics and teachers restlessly&nbsp;await the chance to&nbsp;implement them.<br><strong>Dr Rupert Higham<\/strong><br><em>Associate professor, UCL&nbsp;Institute&nbsp;of&nbsp;Education<\/em><\/p> <p>\u2022 At last, the curriculum review has confirmed what creatives up and down the country have long campaigned for: the end of the English baccalaureate (Ebacc). The qualification had a woeful oversight at its heart \u2013 an absence of arts and vocational subjects.<\/p> <p>Creative subjects should never have been treated like an optional extra for our children\u2019s education. They provide young people with communication skills, independence and adaptability, supporting employability across a range of sectors.<\/p> <p>This move begins to repair the damage done by years of narrowing focus. Yet that progress will only endure if it is matched by joined-up reform beyond the classroom.<\/p> <p>The important work of creative education doesn\u2019t stop at 16, but proposed changes set out in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/post-16-education-and-skills-white-paper\">post-16 education and skills white paper<\/a> raise important questions about this continuation. The new V-levels aim to simplify level 3 qualifications, but it is still unclear if creative subjects will be eligible for maintenance support.<\/p> <p>Unless we join these dots, creativity will be left at the school gate \u2013 and the pipeline cut short. Post-16 policy must build on what schools have just regained. A rounded, cohesive, creative education is one of the most powerful investments this country could make. That cannot stop at 16. <br><strong>Caroline Norbury<\/strong><br><em>Chief executive, Creative UK<\/em><\/p> <p>\u2022 Any rethink of the national curriculum, ambitious or otherwise, faces at least two intractable difficulties. One is captured in the observation \u201cCurriculum is a 10-letter word; that\u2019s the extent of agreement about curriculum\u201d. The other is \u201cEveryone is in favour of reform; it\u2019s change that isn\u2019t liked and will be resisted\u201d. With these caveats in mind, the curriculum and assessment report is a valuable, though overambitious, document that underplays the very difficulties facing the implementation of its many proposals.<br><strong>Prof Colin Richards<\/strong><br><em>Spark Bridge, Cumbria<\/em><\/p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

As part of this, we should also specifically acknowledge the impact of women\u2019s health issues and the role of employers in addressing these.<\/p> <p>In a report by the NHS Confederation in partnership with our foundation, we found that an estimated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhsconfed.org\/publications\/womens-health-economics\">\u00a311bn is lost annually<\/a> due to absenteeism for gynaecological conditions alone. And earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1T7CGizkqhPPSXX_lXpWP83vYjO5ITe86\/view?pli=1\">our research<\/a> found that 15% of women report having to change to part-time work and 14% have had to quit work due to women\u2019s health conditions. Furthermore, 32% of women reported that they aren\u2019t receiving enough support for their health issues from their employers.<\/p> <p>It is therefore essential that employers take action as a matter of urgency. For too long, women have faced persistent inequalities in their career aspirations, and a lack of support for reproductive health issues is one such barrier.<\/p> <p>It is positive to see that the review has highlighted the impact of ill health of the UK\u2019s workforce, and its recommended investment from employers could prove transformational. We also welcome the government\u2019s plans to renew the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/government-announces-womens-health-strategy-to-be-renewed\">women\u2019s health strategy<\/a>, which could provide employers with the guidelines they need to better support women\u2019s health in the workplace. These two commitments together could truly boost the UK\u2019s economy.<br><strong>Prof Geeta Nargund<\/strong><br><em>Founder, Create Health Foundation<\/em><\/p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

As an Italian, vigilantism is for me always a road to fascism, but as an academic, I\u2019m also struck by the contradictions that your article did not pick up on.<\/p> <p>So the road is for everyone, as we all have a right to walking, but if I want a stroll I should \u201cgo to a park\u201d? How about areas that don\u2019t have a park? The issue is that we live in a disconnected world, but two people having a conversation as they walk, or a group having a chat must be shamed? I\u2019m sure Roh&nbsp;pays&nbsp;attention to elderly people and children, but how about hidden disabilities? <\/p> <p>As the mother of a young child, a person with a job that demands flexibility and who was subject to stalking, I have been in the situation of having to look at my phone on my way to the tube.<\/p> <p>I have always tried to be considerate to fellow walkers, but, especially as a mother and a victim, I shouldn\u2019t also have to be worried about a total stranger filming me. And I\u2019m certainly not ready to walk in the efficient single line that is advocated so that it is deemed adequate by some&nbsp;self-appointed&nbsp;judge.<br><strong>Dr Tiziana Morosetti<\/strong><br><em>London<\/em><\/p> <p>\u2022 One of my great bugbears regarding pavement pedestrians walking in opposite directions is \u2013 in which direction should they give way when passing?

Here\u2019s why, 3 November<\/a>)? Most pickleball players <em>are<\/em> over 50! I\u2019d rather see active, smiling people with the odd strain than a generation glued to the sofa. The real health crisis isn\u2019t overexercising \u2013 it\u2019s inactivity.<\/p> <p>Fitness is the biggest predictor of long-term health and independence. Ageing is inevitable, but fragility is not. Women in particular face an accelerated loss of bone and muscle through menopause, yet <a href=\"https:\/\/womeninsport.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Media-stats-pack-January-2022.pdf\">84% of inactive women<\/a> going through menopause want to be more active and 90% would get active if advised by a professional. There is still a societal acceptance that it is OK to be a fragile older lady behind a Zimmer frame with no bum in her trousers.<\/p> <p>Supervised strength training and joyful movement aren\u2019t risks, they\u2019re medicine. Let\u2019s encourage pickleball, hiking or dancing \u2013 anything that builds confidence and keeps people strong. Injuries we can manage, frailty we can\u2019t.<br><strong>Christien Bird<\/strong><br><em>Pelvic health physiotherapist; co-founder, Menopause Movement<\/em><\/p>"

Despite initial momentum, she felt the energy from the frontlines of the strikes had dissipated in the last year. That energy reignited when Mamdani entered the picture.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/nov\/09\/zohran-mamdani-politics-immigrant-identity\">How Mamdani is defying immigrant expectations by embracing his identity: \u2018His boldness resonates\u2019<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>\u201cWe felt so motivated and energized to help people in a city we don\u2019t even live in because of the broader impact on the country,\u201d she said.<\/p> <p>Many of the people interviewed are part of the 4,000 young members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Los Angeles chapter who felt inspired by Mamdani\u2019s campaign and its national implications. Looking ahead, they want to bring the hope and lessons from field organizing back to Los Angeles.<\/p> <p>New York and Los Angeles have very different geographies and spreads of power. In Los Angeles, city council members\u2019 elections tend to have more weight compared to a mayoral race. And given the DSA-LA chapter has endorsed <a href=\"https:\/\/dsa-la.org\/2024-dsa-la-endorsements\/\">five candidates<\/a> so far in the city council and local school board elections, there are plenty of volunteer efforts for these hopefuls to work on in the coming year.<\/p>    <p>Leslie Chang, who serves as the East San Gabriel Valley coordinator for Democratic Socialists of America, flew out during the primaries to canvass for Mamdani. She volunteered to canvass in Chinatown, where she spoke the language, and the Red Hook public housing projects.<\/p> <p>\u201cThese were tough conversations,\u201d Chang said, noting residents felt left out in the city\u2019s development. \u201cThey would say: look at the condition of this place that I live in. We are still waiting for repairs from the hurricane. Why should I give a shit who is running for office if my life hasn\u2019t gotten better?\u201d<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/nov\/07\/readers-zohran-mamdani-win\">Readers on Zohran Mamdani\u2019s victory: \u2018It was a collective exhale\u2019<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>During her volunteer field training, Chang met two New York City council members who were vouching for Mamdani\u2019s mayoral campaign. They told Chang to give out their phone numbers to start conversations with constituents.<\/p> <p>\u201cI thought that was really powerful, because in almost all of the canvases that I do here [in Los Angeles], there isn\u2019t that level of engagement,\u201d she said. After canvassing, there was even a social event for volunteers to get to know one another and discuss what strategies worked best.<\/p> <p>Paul Zappia, an animator and illustrator who also serves in DSA-LA leadership, first met the mayor-elect in 2023 at the DSA national conference in Chicago, where Mamdani served as a keynote speaker. He flew out in late October to canvass with friends in Bushwick. At the beginning of his shift, the field lead asked why each volunteer had come out.<\/p> <p>\u201cI shared with everybody that I was here from Los Angeles because the victory of Zohran Mamdani is bigger than New York City,\u201d said Zappia, who attributes his involvement in politics to the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign.<\/p>    <p>Even walking to lunch a few blocks away, he encountered another canvassing group. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of people who are there on their free time and want to spend a couple hours on their Saturday together with other people that also care about their fellow working class people. And it was just such a blast,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>The geography and public transportation layout of New York\u2019s five boroughs makes it easier to canvas in groups. Zappia said he could feasibly knock on hundreds of doors in a one-block radius there. In Los Angeles, a street could be filled with mostly single-family homes. And with the abundance of Ring doorbell cameras, people can easily decline a visitor from the comfort of their couch.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/nov\/06\/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats\">How Mamdani built an \u2018unstoppable force\u2019 that won over New York<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>Clayton Ryles, 31, only canvassed for one afternoon in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown in late October and felt the contrast between Mamdani\u2019s campaign and others. In September last year, Ryles canvassed for Kamala Harris with his fellow United Auto Worker labor organizers in Las Vegas. Knocks on doors yielded intrepid voters who were \u201cupset and suspicious\u201d. Despite many people being pro-union, they felt that their cost of living was too high under Joe Biden.<\/p> <p>\u201cNobody was excited about the election. Everybody was like this is being inflicted upon us. We have to decide one way or another. For Zohran, most of the people were enthusiastic about what could happen with his mayoral tenure,\u201d Ryles said.<\/p> <p>Davarpanah agreed, pointing to the call and response levels of Mamdani\u2019s speech when crowds could clearly repeat phrases such as \u201cfast and free buses\u201d and \u201cuniversal childcare\u201d.<\/p> <p>\u201cYou can name them. Harris 2024 was not successful in articulating a vision,\u201d she said. \u201cA policy vision that materially impacts your constituents is something every candidate should take to heart. This is what actually inspires people to get involved when they actually see what you\u2019re going to deliver.\u201d<\/p>    <p>Across social media, users have been making posts about how California, and Los Angeles specifically, needs a Mamdani.<\/p> <p>For Zappia, that means bringing back hope after a tough year that started with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/california-wildfires\">Altadena wildfires<\/a> and has continued with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/nov\/01\/trump-immigration-chicago-los-angeles-halloween\">ICE raids<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2025\/nov\/06\/snap-cuts-how-to-help\">cutbacks to Snap benefits<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2025\/oct\/16\/inflation-economic-pessimism-poll\">rising inflation<\/a>, among many other difficulties.<\/p> <p>\u201cPeople are just really looking for a sort of sign that things can turn around. In order to actually affect the change that we want to see, we have to first believe that we can actually do it,\u201d he said.<\/p> <p>\u201cAnd what happened in New York City is proof that it can be done, it\u2019s proof that organized people can beat organized money.\u201d<\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>Royal Mail says that it has \u201cdelivered Christmas\u201d for more than 500 years, but this year many workers have been left feeling less than festive after the company downgraded a small gift to workers to second class.<\/p> <p>The postal service, which traces its history back to the appointment of a \u201cmaster of the posts\u201d by Henry VIII in 1516, has given workers a collection of 50 Christmas stamps to recognise their work over the busiest time of year. In previous years, including in 2024, workers have received a book of 50 or 100 first-class stamps, but that has quietly been switched to second class this year.<\/p> <p>The downgraded perk has caused bemusement among Royal Mail\u2019s workers. It is the first Christmas since Royal Mail\u2019s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), was bought by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2024\/dec\/16\/who-is-daniel-kretinsky-the-new-boss-of-royal-mail\">Czech billionaire<\/a> Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd.<\/p> <p>Seasonal stamps have been a popular feature of the service since 1966, after they were introduced under <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/jul\/04\/eventually-it-will-just-be-a-barcode-wont-it-why-britains-new-stamps-are-causing-outrage-and-upset\">Labour postmaster general Tony Benn<\/a>. This year\u2019s edition features biblical scenes illustrated by British artist Paula Doherty, while previous versions have included illustrator Quentin Blake\u2019s 1993 rendition of <a href=\"https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/?t=ffab&amp;q=scrooge+christmas+carol+stamp&amp;ia=images&amp;iax=images&amp;iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linns.com%2Fimages%2Fdefault-source%2Fnews%2Ftopics-on-stamps-charles-dickens-a-christmas-carol-great-britian-scrooge.tmb-slide-1900.jpg%3FCulture%3Den%26sfvrsn%3Daa1631da_0\">Ebenezer Scrooge<\/a> from Charles Dickens\u2019s A Christmas Carol.<\/p>    <p>Although the immediate costs of the gift to the Royal Mail would be limited to some extra printing and the delivery costs, a sheet of 50 first-class stamps would nominally be worth \u00a385 since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2025\/mar\/07\/royal-mail-price-first-class-stamp-second-class\">the price rose to \u00a31.70 in April<\/a> \u2013 more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/shortcuts\/2020\/feb\/24\/cost-first-class-stamp-royal-mail\">double the price in 2020<\/a>. A second-class stamp costs 87p \u2013 a potentially significant saving for a business that employs 130,000 people.<\/p> <p>The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said that workers were irritated by the message the change sent.<\/p> <p>A CWU spokesperson said: \u201cThe decision to send employees second-class stamps this Christmas exemplifies the way Royal Mail has been treating its staff for a long time now. Whilst postal workers are disappointed at this latest development they will, as always continue to deliver a first-class service to customers and businesses across the UK.\u201d<\/p> <p>The change comes as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2025\/sep\/01\/royal-mail-profit-takeover-ids-daniel-kretinsky\">Royal Mail cuts back second-class deliveries<\/a>, after it was allowed to make changes to the universal service obligation.<\/p> <p>A Royal Mail spokesperson said: \u201cEvery Christmas, Royal Mail recognises the hard work of colleagues in a number of ways, including a frontline bonus, free stamps and a wider recognition programme, to thank them for their efforts during our busiest time of year. This year, we\u2019ve included 50 second-class stamps to reflect recent changes to the universal service obligation and to help keep mail moving smoothly for customers throughout the festive season.\u201d<\/p> <p>In previous years the stamps gift was usually sent at the end of November, but this year\u2019s second-class stamps were delivered earlier than expected.<\/p> <p>Other gifts in the past have raised eyebrows among workers, including a pack of seeds, and a comb another year, which was appreciated less by Royal Mail\u2019s contingent of bald workers.<\/p> <p>A picture of a Christmas card sent this year to workers at Royal Mail said: \u201cWe have been delivering Christmas for over 500 years. We know that every gift, card and letter is important \u2013 and never more so than at this time of the year. At Royal Mail and Parcelforce we don\u2019t just deliver Christmas, we are Christmas.\u201d<\/p> <p>The letter was signed by Royal Mail\u2019s executive team. It was not signed by IDS\u2019s leadership, or by K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd.<\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>My father, Peter Edwards, who has died aged 90, was a pioneer of wind energy and set up the UK\u2019s first commercial windfarm in 1991.<\/p> <p>Peter opened the Delabole windfarm in north Cornwall on land belonging to a farm he had been running since the 1960s. For its first two decades it operated 10 400kW turbines, feeding into the National Grid and generating enough power for nearly 3,000 homes. In 2010 the original turbines were decommissioned and an \u00a311.8m rebuild replaced them with four turbines with a power output of 9.2 megawatts, providing enough for more than 7,800 homes.<\/p> <p>Together with his son, Martin, and through their consultancy firm Windelectric Management, Peter also helped dozens of other farmers to negotiate deals with wind turbine operators who wanted to build on their land.<\/p> <p>During the 90s he served as a member of the parliamentary renewable and sustainable energy group, was chair of the British Wind Energy Association (1996\u201398) and chair of the Renewable Energy Association (2002\u201304). He was also frequently invited to give talks and lectures, including to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wrenuk.co.uk\/\">World Renewable Energy Congress<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Peter was born in King\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk, as the only child of Violet (nee Brooker) and her husband, George. His father was an RAF squadron leader who was frequently posted away from home, so he grew up with his mother at his maternal grandmother\u2019s home on the Isle of Wight, where he attended Ryde school.<\/p> <p>When his father was posted to the US, Peter accompanied his parents before returning to the UK in 1955 to study agriculture at the University of Reading. There he met fellow student Philippa Fielding, whom he married in 1958; they had three children: Martin, Jeremy and me. <\/p> <p>On graduation in 1959, Peter was appointed as a government conservation officer for the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe), where he completed a two-year contract designing and implementing plans for soil conservation, drainage and water storage. He and his family came back to the UK in 1961 to establish the farm in Delabole, with Philippa as a partner in the business. <\/p> <p>As the dairy industry became increasingly difficult to manage, Peter and Philippa decided to sell their herd in 1987 and capitalise on the abundant wind around the north Cornish coast. The investment in turbines was a constructive response to an unpopular proposal for a nuclear power plant at Luxulyan in mid-Cornwall, with the hope of pushing the UK in a greener direction. From 2002 the Delabole windfarm was owned and operated by Good Energy, before GE was bought by the UAE-based company Esyasoft earlier this year.<\/p> <p>Throughout its time as a windfarm, the land has continued to produce grass to feed cattle and sheep, and has been planted with around 500,000 native trees on less productive areas. Peter was always a keen practitioner of low-intensity \u201cnature-friendly\u201d farming.<\/p> <p>Philippa died in 2021. He is survived by his three children, five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.<\/p>"

                    "headline": "Can Donald Trump really make an NFL team name its stadium after him?",
                    "body": "<h2>Wait, Donald Trump is naming a stadium after himself?<\/h2> <p>That\u2019s if <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2025\/nov\/08\/trump-name-washington-commanders-stadium\">a well-sourced report from ESPN<\/a> is to be believed. The US president has apparently let it be known to the ownership group of the Washington Commanders that he wants the team\u2019s new stadium, which is scheduled to open in 2030, to take his name. \u201cIt\u2019s what the president wants, and it will probably happen,\u201d a senior White House official <a href=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nfl\/story\/_\/id\/46892115\/trump-wants-commanders-stadium-named-him\">told ESPN<\/a>.<\/p> <h2>Presumably Trump, as a serial winner, has chosen the Commanders because they\u2019re the best team in the NFL?<\/h2> <p>Not quite. While the franchise was a dominant force in the 1980s, its last Super Bowl appearance came in the 1991 season. Although the Commanders\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2024\/oct\/01\/jayden-daniels-quarterback-washington-commanders-nfl-football\">fortunes were revived last season<\/a> thanks to new owners and a brilliant young quarterback in Jayden Daniels, their form has slumped again this season.<\/p> <h2>So why would want Trump want to be associated with them?<\/h2> <p>Good point \u2013 what would Trump have in common with a team with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2018\/may\/02\/washington-cheerleaders-escort-allegations-nfl\">a dubious history with women<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/ghostsofdc.org\/2023\/01\/18\/redskins-commanders-last-nfl-team-integrate-1962\/\">minorities<\/a>? Having said that, the move would give Trump two things he enjoys: power and revenge. The NFL is by far the most popular league in America, as well as the richest in the world \u2013 having his name on one of its stadiums will make sure he is even more prominent than he already is. It would also be a counterpunch against a league with which Trump has had a fractious relationship. In 1983 he bought a franchise in the rival United States Football League in an attempt to force a merger with the NFL, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2018\/sep\/11\/the-day-donald-trumps-narcissism-killed-the-usfl\">only to wind up sinking the younger league<\/a>. In 2014, Trump was frustrated in his attempt to enter the NFL\u2019s inner circle when his bid to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2014\/aug\/07\/donald-trump-buffalo-bills-sale-nfl\">buy the Buffalo Bills<\/a> fell short. The clashes have continued into his presidency: during his first term, he described NFL <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2017\/sep\/22\/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\">players protesting against social injustice<\/a> as \u201csons of bitches\u201d. In his second term he has urged the Commanders to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2025\/jul\/21\/trump-commanders-guardians-name-change-nfl-mlb\">revert to their previous racist nickname<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2025\/oct\/22\/goodell-defends-bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show\">attacked the league\u2019s decision<\/a> to choose Trump critic Bad Bunny to play the Super Bowl\u2019s halftime show this season.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2025\/nov\/08\/trump-name-washington-commanders-stadium\">Trump reportedly wants new NFL stadium in Washington named after him <\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <h2>Will he succeed?<\/h2> <p>This is a man who has already managed to summon up various Trump Towers, Trump Plaza, Trump Steaks, Trump University, Trump Shuttle, Trump Vodka, Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Mortgage and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trumphotels.com\/turnberry\/weddings\/venues\">Donald J Trump Ballroom<\/a> (to name but a few). Plus, Trump has become adept at getting billionaires to do what he wants of late, while he has found himself given <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2025\/feb\/08\/super-bowl-trump-end-racism-politics\">a warmer greeting in the sports world<\/a> in his second term as president. The route to naming the stadium is a little tricky but Trump has leverage. As president, he oversees the federal agencies responsible for environmental and land-use approvals at the proposed site of the team\u2019s new stadium, so he could speed up, or slow down, the process if he chose to. \u201cHe has cards to play,\u201d one source told ESPN. \u201cHe can make it very difficult to get this stadium built unless people align with him on the name.\u201d <\/p> <p>It should also be noted that the Commanders will not be the ones to name the stadium. The proposed site sits on National Park Service land, and the District of Columbia Council will lease the stadium to the team. Again, Trump can lean on these bodies if he so chooses. \u201cThe team doesn\u2019t have the authority. They can\u2019t name the stadium on their own,\u201d a source with direct knowledge of the process told ESPN. \u201cThe city would be involved, and the Park Service would be involved.\u201d<\/p> <h2>Are other NFL stadiums named after people?<\/h2> <p>They are, but those people tend to be dead. Two of the most famous stadiums in the NFL \u2013 Green Bay\u2019s Lambeau Field and Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field \u2013 are tributes to people who have passed away. In Green Bay\u2019s case, the stadium was renamed for the team\u2019s founder and coach Earl \u201cCurly\u201c Lambeau a few months after his death, while the stadium in Chicago was a tribute to US soldiers who had died in the first world war. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/blog\/2015\/sep\/15\/ancient-leaking-soulless-a-guide-to-americas-worst-stadiums\">Washington\u2019s former stadium<\/a> was named after a politician, but its name illustrates how it differed from Trump\u2019s proposal: the Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium was renamed as a tribute to the US senator who was assassinated several months beforehand. It\u2019s also notable that Lambeau and RFK did not lobby to get their names on the stadiums.<\/p> <h2>So which stadiums are named after living world leaders?<\/h2> <p>It should be noted that Trump would \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2025\/oct\/31\/trump-third-term-constitution\">probably<\/a> \u2013 be out of power by the time the new Commanders stadium opens. But you can draw your own conclusions from living leaders who have their names on stadiums. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2025\/oct\/27\/cameroon-paul-biya-oldest-serving-head-of-state-declared-winner-in-election\">Cameroon\u2019s authoritarian leader<\/a> has the Paul Biya Omnisports Stadium, India\u2019s authoritarian leader has the Narendra Modi Stadium, Saudi Arabia\u2019s authoritarian de facto leader has the proposed Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium,<strong> <\/strong>while Sierra Leone\u2019s authoritarian leader had the Siaka Stevens National Stadium while he was in power. Hong Kong also went for the Queen Elizabeth Stadium during her reign, but she was a monarch and therefore <a href=\"https:\/\/people.com\/donald-trump-calls-himself-king-as-white-house-shares-fake-time-cover-11683451?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">completely different from Trump<\/a>.<\/p>"

The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/american-airlines-warns-problems-faa-flight-cuts-increase-2025-11-07\/\">warned<\/a> that flight reductions could reach 20% if the shutdown persists, and on Sunday he predicted a \u201csubstantial\u201d number of people in the US would be unable to celebrate the upcoming holidays with their families if the shutdown wasn\u2019t resolved.<\/p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,\u201d Duffy said Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe have a number of people who want to get home for the holidays. They want to see their family \u2026 Listen, many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn\u2019t open back up.\u201d<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/nov\/08\/flight-cancellations-government-shutdown\">Nearly 1,500 flights canceled on second day of cuts tied to government shutdown<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>The FAA\u2019s requirement for airlines to cut 4% of daily flights at 40 \u201chigh-traffic\u201d US airports began on Friday and represented an attempt to ease the mounting pressure on air traffic controllers. Like other federal employees, those controllers have not been paid for weeks amid the government shutdown, which has become the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/nov\/04\/government-shutdown-longest-history\">longest in history<\/a> and reached its 40th day.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing signs of stress in the system, so we are proactively reducing the number of flights to make sure the American people continue to fly safely,\u201d the FAA administrator, Bryan Bedford, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2025\/nov\/07\/passengers-face-global-disruption-as-flights-cut-amid-us-government-shutdown\">said<\/a> earlier this week. He also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/sustainability\/sustainable-finance-reporting\/us-hit-with-second-day-flight-cuts-shutdown-drags-2025-11-08\/\">said<\/a> that between 20% to 40% of controllers had not been showing up for work over the last several days.<\/p> <p>The first round of flight reductions led to around 800 cancellations on Friday and 1,460 on Saturday. As of 9am ET on Sunday, more than 1,000 flights across the US had been cancelled for the day, according to the flight tracking website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flightaware.com\/live\/cancelled\/today\">FlightAware<\/a>.<\/p> <p>On Sunday, Duffy told CNN that the US is \u201cshort air traffic controllers\u201d and that he was \u201ctrying to get more air traffic controllers into the towers and be certified, but I am about a 1,000 to 2,000 controllers short\u201d.<\/p> <p>Airlines were offering full refunds to customers for canceled flights.<\/p> <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has warned that the shutdown was worsening the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.natca.org\/2025\/10\/24\/americas-air-traffic-controllers-to-receive-first-0-paycheck-on-oct-28-2\/\">staffing<\/a> shortages <a href=\"https:\/\/www.natca.org\/2025\/10\/31\/official-statement-of-natca-president-nick-daniels-on-the-ongoing-government-shutdown\/\">and<\/a> said that many controllers \u201care working 10-hour days and six-day workweeks due to the ongoing staffing shortage, all without pay.<\/p> <p>\u201cThis situation creates substantial distractions for individuals who are already engaged in extremely stressful work,\u201d they said. \u201cThe financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown.\u201d<\/p> <p>On Saturday, the union said it had delivered 1,600 handwritten letters from members to Congress calling for the shutdown to end.<\/p> <p>As the shutdown drags on, Democratic and Republican lawmakers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/oct\/01\/government-shutdown-reactions\">continued to blame each other for the impasse<\/a> \u2013 and for the flight disruptions.<\/p> <p>On Friday, the White House <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/articles\/2025\/11\/democrats-are-to-blame-for-airport-chaos\/\">blamed<\/a> Democrats for the cancellations and delays, saying they \u201care inflicting their man-made catastrophe on Americans just trying to make life-saving medical trips or get home for Thanksgiving\u201d.<\/p> <p>On Saturday, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/SenSchumer\/status\/1987258408719053152?s=20\">accused<\/a> the Republicans of \u201cplaying games\u201d and <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/SenSchumer\/status\/1987258408719053152?s=20\">said<\/a>: \u201cInstead of negotiating with Democrats, Republicans would rather let air-traffic controllers go unpaid, they\u2019d rather ground flights, and they\u2019d rather punish travelers.\u201d<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2025\/nov\/07\/passengers-face-global-disruption-as-flights-cut-amid-us-government-shutdown\">Passengers start to feel bite of flight cuts amid US government shutdown<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>For passengers, uncertainty remained about which flights would be canceled, and analysts warned that the disruption would likely intensify and spread beyond air travel if cancellations keep growing and reach into Thanksgiving week.<\/p> <p>The moderator of NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Kristen Welker, asked the Democratic US House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, if the shutdown would end before Thanksgiving. \u201cI hope so,\u201d Jeffries said.<\/p> <p>Asked the same question by Welker, Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said \u201cit absolutely needs to \u2013 it needs to open today if we can get it open\u201d.<\/p> <p>Rental car companies reported a sharp increase in one-way reservations Friday, and some people simply canceled flights altogether.<\/p> <p>Some analysts have pointed out that there was the potential for higher prices in stores, as nearly half of US air freight is shipped in the bellies of passenger aircraft. There is also the possibility of higher shipping costs that get passed on to consumers, and further losses, from tourism to manufacturing, that will ripple through the economy if the slowdown continues.<\/p> <p><em>The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting<\/em><\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>A Russian opposition activist arrested in Poland and due to go on trial next month has admitted he worked as an undercover agent for Russia\u2019s FSB security service and informed on other opposition figures, court documents claim.<\/p> <p>Igor Rogov, 30, has been associated with various opposition movements in the Russian city of Saransk, including Alexei Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation and Open Russia, linked to the exiled businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky.<\/p> <p>Rogov and his wife left Russia in 2021, according to the court documents, and in 2022 they received visas for Poland, where they arrived a few days after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and settled in the city of Sosnowiec.<\/p> <p>Rogov was arrested by Polish authorities last summer, initially due to suspected links to an explosive package. Poland has been hit by a wave of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/ng-interactive\/2025\/may\/04\/these-people-are-disposable-how-russia-is-using-online-recruits-for-a-campaign-of-sabotage-in-europe\">arson and other sabotage attacks<\/a> that involve one-time operatives on the ground and are believed to be run by Russian intelligence operatives.<\/p> <p>Later, Rogov\u2019s wife, Irina Rogova, was also arrested, and the couple were accused of cooperating with the FSB to inform on other Russian opposition activists.<\/p> <p>Poland has arrested numerous people on charges of preparing or carrying out sabotage on behalf of Russia over the last two years. Many are Polish, Ukrainian or Belarusian citizens believed to have been recruited via Telegram for one-time paid jobs. Rogov\u2019s case is unusual in that he is a Russian citizen and appears to have been in direct contact with the FSB for some years.<\/p> <p>The Guardian obtained an anonymised copy of the indictment against Rogov and his wife from the Polish court. In accordance with local laws, he is referred to only as Igor R, but exiled Russian media outlets and other sources have identified the defendant as Rogov.<\/p> <p>The files suggest a long history of cooperation with the FSB. Rogov admitted to interrogators that he had been approached by the security service several years ago while still in Russia and coerced into infiltrating the local branch of an opposition movement.<\/p> <p>He said he was given a burner phone and sim cards to contact his FSB handler, and when \u201ccooperation reached a higher level\u201d he had in-person meetings at an unmarked apartment near the local FSB headquarters. \u201cAt that time, he also began to receive money in exchange for cooperation,\u201d according to the indictment.<\/p> <p>Rogov told his wife he had been recruited by the FSB, according to the indictment, which quotes her as saying he \u201cprobably received money for this, because he was not working at the time but he had money\u201d.<\/p> <p>Later, in Poland, Rogov asked his wife to help him transfer to his handlers an encrypted USB stick with reports on Russian activists and others in Poland who might be of interest to the FSB. He gave her the USB stick to take on a visit to Russia hidden in a package together with souvenirs from Poland, and an address to post it to.<\/p> <p>Details from the indictment were previously published by the Polish outlet Wirtualna Polska, which also said Rogov had been blackmailed by the FSB to cooperate when in Poland, with the threat that if he did not, his father would be conscripted to serve in the Russian army.<\/p> <p>Leonid Volkov, of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, said he could not recall ever meeting Rogov but that the case demonstrated typical methods used by the Russian authorities. <\/p> <p>\u201cThis is not surprising. The FSB has always done this, still does it and will carry on doing so: finding young people with vulnerabilities, recruiting them and then sending them into opposition organisations,\u201d he wrote on X.<\/p> <p>Another part of the case against Rogov deals with a package that he was reported to have handled. The package contained the components of an explosive device and was addressed to Rogov, although he never received it. He said he had agreed to receive the package as a favour to a friend. A Ukrainian woman was also arrested over the package but has since been released.<\/p> <p>Since 2022, Poland has made it hard for Russians to get visas, with exceptions made only for those in extreme humanitarian need or those such as Rogov with a background in opposition movements.<\/p> <p>The first hearing in the trial of the Rogovs is due to take place on 8 December.<\/p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ada Petriczko<\/em><\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>Crystal Palace supporters have spent the past six months taking great pleasure in reminding their Brighton counterparts that they have yet to win a major trophy. So the first meeting of the two clubs since Oliver Glasner\u2019s side <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2025\/apr\/05\/crystal-palace-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">did the double<\/a> over their adversaries from down the A23 for the first time since 1933 \u2013 before going on to win the FA Cup \u2013 was never going to be one for the faint-hearted.<\/p> \n<p>But while the streets of south London had the usual heavy police presence for a rivalry that dates back to the days when these clubs were managed by Terry Venables and Alan Mullery in the late 1970s, there wasn\u2019t the same quality to match the passion on display.<\/p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2025\/nov\/09\/nottingham-forest-leeds-premier-league-match-report\">Sean Dyche\u2019s Nottingham Forest revival gathers pace as fightback sinks Leeds<\/a> <\/p> \n<\/aside> \n<p>Palace maintained their record of not having lost against Brighton here since March 2019, although Fabian H\u00fcrzeler\u2019s team will see this as a chance spurned as they failed to take advantage of opponents who are running on fumes given the extra demands of a Conference League campaign that left them without captain Marc Gu\u00e9hi.<\/p> \n<p>Jaydee Canvot proved to be an able deputy, even if he must have had his heart in his mouth when the referee pointed to the spot in the second half after Georginio Rutter went down. However, the video assistant referee called Tim Robinson to the pitchside monitor and the referee ruled that the forward had dived.<\/p> \n<p>\u201cI think he had a very good game but the whole team really defended well,\u201d Glasner said of the France Under-21 international before revealing that Gu\u00e9hi did not fracture a bone against AZ on Thursday night. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy bone bruise, it\u2019s swollen, he can\u2019t walk, he\u2019s on crutches. I don\u2019t know if England wants to see him. I think if he arrives with crutches, they will send him home.\u201d<\/p> \n<p>In the week he was recalled by Thomas Tuchel, Adam Wharton lasted 65 minutes and got the better of another highly rated midfielder in the form of Carlos Baleba, yet neither could have a decisive say. H\u00fcrzeler \u2013 who, his 59th match in charge, named an unchanged side for the first time \u2013 said his players could have snatched the victory. \u201cWe had the chances and we were the better team, so therefore you can say it\u2019s a missed opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can also see from a different perspective that there were a lot of positive things to take away.\u201d<\/p> \n<p>This has been a stop-start campaign for Brighton so far but after a run of three wins in their last five Premier League games, their manager admitted in the buildup they were \u201cdesperate\u201d to notch up another in an atmosphere that is always frenzied.<\/p> \n<p>That was certainly the case in the opening 10 minutes as both sides went on the attack, with Jean\u2011Philippe Mateta picking up where he left off on Thursday by blazing over inside the opening three minutes. Diego G\u00f3mez was flagged offside after forcing Dean Henderson into a save at the other end before a brilliant full-stretch dive from Bart Verbruggen denied a curling effort from Isma\u00efla Sarr at the end of a flowing Palace move.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"17c660cc-0f15-4405-8487-4c0d38de4383\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>The Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/info\/2025\/sep\/29\/upgrade-your-downtime-with-guardian-puzzles\">the launch of its first daily football game<\/a>, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android \u2026 so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n   <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n <\/gu-atom> \n<\/figure> \n<p>H\u00fcrzeler was shown a yellow card after taking exception to one decision and neither manager looked particularly happy as the game descended into a midfield battle with precious little space in which to work. A set piece seemed the most likely source of a breakthrough and Lewis Dunk \u2013 making the 500th appearance of his career \u2013 did well to clear after Jefferson Lerma directed his header from Wharton\u2019s free-kick dangerously across the face of goal.<\/p> \n<p>Robinson appeared reluctant to issue another caution when Yasin Ayari took out Wharton after he turned on to a forward pass from the assured Canvot and Lerma clashed with Danny Welbeck. Brighton should have at least tested Henderson when they swept downfield in a quick break just before half\u2011time but Yankuba Minteh dragged his shot horribly wide.<\/p> \n<p>G\u00f3mez pressed the England goalkeeper into action at the start of the second half when he connected with Minteh\u2019s cross as Brighton sensed an opportunity. Palace also remained a threat but Daichi Kamada could not make it count after Wharton caught Baleba in possession and Sarr picked out the Japan international inside the area. <\/p> \n<p>Baleba found his way into the referee\u2019s notebook soon afterwards for fouling Tyrick Mitchell \u2013 a decision that was greeted with ironic cheers from the home supporters.<\/p> \n<p>Palace came closest to snatching all three points when Yeremy Pino, on as a substitute, forced Verbruggen into a save at his near post in the sixth minute of stoppage time but had to settle for just one after another busy few days.<\/p>"

                    "body": "<p>The Sean Dyche era is fully up and running at Nottingham Forest after he secured his first Premier League win as head coach at the third time of asking. Leeds were barely worthy opponents, which is concerning considering the two teams could face a long battle for survival.<\/p> \n<p>Lukas Nmecha put Leeds ahead but they quickly withdrew their challenge as Ibrahim Sangar\u00e9, Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson secured for Forest a first Premier League victory in 10 matches, to move them one point off 17th.<\/p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2025\/nov\/09\/brentford-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">Late Thiago double earns comeback win for Brentford against 10-man Newcastle<\/a> <\/p> \n<\/aside> \n<p>The final whistle was greeted with a roar inside the City Ground and fireworks outside to show the fuse had been lit. \u201cThere\u2019s good signs here and there\u2019s real signs of people committing to the cause, and I always think that\u2019s important,\u201d Dyche said.<\/p> \n<p>\u201cOf course every player earns money and all that, what about the commitment to the cause? What about the commitment to each other? Start with each other, the fans and the badge, so they\u2019re important things, and when we get to that, then you know you\u2019re on to some people, we\u2019re going towards that.\u201d<\/p> \n<p>Two goals 135 seconds apart were the only two noteworthy incidents of a dreadful first half. Errors played a key part in both. Nmecha\u2019s opener was Leeds\u2019s first real involvement in the clash, coming 13 minutes in. The striker\u2019s finish was clinical after the visitors capitalised on inept defending from Nicol\u00f2 Savona 25 yards from goal. It was Leeds\u2019s only shot of the first half.<\/p> \n<p>It failed to embolden Leeds as they soon relinquished their advantage. Sangar\u00e9 was quickest to react to Lucas Perri palming a cross out into the box, when holding the ball did not seem difficult. It was the midfielder\u2019s first goal for the club since arriving in 2023 from PSV Eindhoven, opening his account and bringing the match to life with one sidefooted shot.<\/p> \n<p>\u201cWe should not give away the lead so easily and cheaply,\u201d Daniel Farke said. \u201cSmall details are always decisive and there were a few details that were not good enough today.\u201d<\/p> \n<p>Without a league win since the opening weekend, Forest needed a reaction against a relegation rival. Dyche\u2019s moulding of the team is becoming more apparent as each game passes. The winger Dan Ndoye operated as an auxiliary right-back when Leeds had possession to try to quell the threat down Forest\u2019s right.<\/p> \n<p>Leeds offered little to no attacking potency throughout the first half. Nmecha, who replaced Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the starting lineup, struggled with the aerial dominance and physicality of Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo, winning very little in the air and without the support to get the second balls.<\/p> \n<p>Neither side exuded confidence; Forest repeatedly got into the final third without possessing a clinical final ball into the box, while Leeds were the masters of losing possession with ill-advised passes and running into dead ends. Dyche ensured the channels were hit regularly and Gibbs-White tried to get on the ball in an attempt to create something but was not at his inventive best. \u201cI just want him to keep playing with a smile,\u201d Dyche said of his captain.<\/p> \n<p>It felt like an occasion where the players needed to do something to inspire the fans, rather than vice versa amid a City Ground lull. It was quiet as 22 men constantly toiled without producing much to justify the ticket price. Forest are clearly better organised than under Ange Postecoglou but required a cutting edge.<\/p> \n<p>Dyche, who has lost only once in five games in charge, tried to provide that with a triple substitution before the hour. Omari Hutchinson, Taiwo Awoniyi and Ryan Yates were sent on to add guile and workrate with Forest sensing the match was there to be won. Hutchinson swung a perfect cross from the right, which Gibbs\u2011White flicked into the corner to bring the ground back to life. <\/p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been through a tough period recently,\u201d Gibbs-White said of Hutchinson. \u201cHe stayed resilient and strong. He proved today why he should be in the 11.\u201d<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"17c660cc-0f15-4405-8487-4c0d38de4383\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>The Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/info\/2025\/sep\/29\/upgrade-your-downtime-with-guardian-puzzles\">the launch of its first daily football game<\/a>, On the ball.

The makeshift defender proved his naivety by bundling over Hutchinson inside the box and Anderson did the rest to remove any lasting nerves.<\/p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone needed it [the win], I need it as much as everyone else does. I\u2019m the manager, you work to get wins, that\u2019s what keeps you in the business,\u201d Dyche said, and few know the industry better.<\/p>"
